Several astrophysical inferences\nare then drawn, including the evidence for rich clusters having evolved without\nmuch baryon exchange with their surrondings, and having experienced very\nsimilar star formation histories. Groups are much gas-poor compared to\nclusters, and appear instead to have shed a major fraction of their original\ncosmic share of baryons, which indicates that galaxy clusters cannot have\nformed by assembling groups similar to the present day ones. It is argued that\nthis favors low-$\\Omega$ universes, in which the growth of rich clusters is\nvirtually complete at high redshifts. It is also argued that elemental\nabundance ratios in clusters are nearly solar, which is consistent with a\nsimilar proportion of supernovae of Type Ia and Type II having enriched both\nthe solar neghborhood as well clusters as a whole. Much of the iron in clusters\nappears to reside in the intracluster medium rather than inside galaxies.

This\nsimple representation of the precession of the orbit neglects two important\naspects of the orbital dynamics of a binary pulsar with an oblate companion.\nFirst, the quasiperiodic effects along the orbit, due to the anisotropic\n$1/r^3$ nature of the quadrupole potential.

The methods described in this paper, McQuitty's similarity analysis,\nWard's minimum-variance method, and the EM algorithm, assign each instance of\nan ambiguous word to a known sense definition based solely on the values of\nautomatically identifiable features in text. These methods and feature sets are\nfound to be more successful in disambiguating nouns rather than adjectives or\nverbs. Overall, the most accurate of these procedures is McQuitty's similarity\nanalysis in combination with a high dimensional feature set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 1997 22:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

You will find that our software\nsatisfies the highest standards of software design, implementation, testing,\nand benchmarking.\n  The current LIBPA release is a source code distribution only. It consists of\nmodules for portable memory management, one dimensional arrays of arbitrary\ntypes, compact symbol tables, hash tables for arbitrary types, a trie module\nfor length-delimited strings over arbitrary alphabets, single precision\nfloating point numbers with extended exponents, and logarithmic representations\nof probability values using either fixed or floating point numbers.\n  We have used LIBPA to implement a wide range of statistical models for both\ncontinuous and discrete domains. The time and space efficiency of LIBPA has\nallowed us to build larger statistical models than previously reported, and to\ninvestigate more computationally-intensive techniques than previously possible.\nWe have found LIBPA to be indispensible in our own research, and hope that you\nwill find it useful in yours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 1997 01:27:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
