We show\nthat this source is most likely an old isolated neutron star accreting from\nsurrounding media. We then argue that unless it was born with a long spin\nperiod (P_i >~ 0.5 seconds) and weak field (B_i <~ 10^10 G), the magnetic field\non this star must have decayed. With B_i ~ 10^12 G, we find decay timescales >~\n10^7 yrs for power law decay or >~ 10^8 yrs for exponential decay. A measured\nperiod derivative Pdot <~ 10^{-16} s s^{-1} would be consistent with an old\naccreting isolated neutron star. Both power law and exponential decay models\ncan give a Pdot ~ 10^{-16} s s^{-1}, though a Pdot substantially less than this\nwould be indicative of exponential field decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jun 1997 22:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
