To quantify this statement we can either investigate their\nobserved properties (see Fossati et al., this volume), or try to determine\ntheir intrinsic physical parameters by applying specific models, and trying to\nfit their SED. Results of the latter approach are reported here. We applied\nsimple, one-zone, homogeneous models to all blazars strongly detected in the\ngamma-ray band, assuming or not the presence of seed (for the inverse Compton\nprocess) photons produced outside the active region. Our results suggest that\nthe SEDs of blazars are ruled by the amount of radiative cooling suffered by\nthe electrons producing most of the emission. In turn, the amount of cooling is\nruled by the amount of the external photon emission, which can be identified\nwith radiation coming from the broad line clouds. Blazar SEDs are therefore\norganized in a sequence: objects with no or very weak emission lines (X-ray\nselected BL Lacs, or HBL) are characterized by very high electron energies and\na Compton luminosity of the same order of the synchrotron one. These are TeV\nsources. BL Lacertae objects selected in the radio band (or LBL) are\ncharacterized by smaller electron energies, more total power and more line\nluminosity, and by a larger ratio of the Compton to synchrotron luminosity.\nThey are GeV sources. Increasing the total intrinsic power and the line\nemission luminosity, we have smaller still electron energies (more cooling) and\ngreater still Compton to synchrotron power ratio. These are flat spectrum radio\nquasars, with a high energy peak located at MeV-GeV energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 1997 16:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Implications for this finding are\ndiscussed. LINERs are detected at a similar rate to Seyfert 2s, constituting a\nstrong argument that at least some nuclear LINERs are AGN rather than\nstarbursts, since starbursts have not been detected as H2O megamasers. We\npreferentially detect H2O emission from the nearer galaxies and from those\nwhich are apparently brighter at mid- and far-infrared and centimeter radio\nwavelengths.

However, such superpartners also\ninduce non-decoupling effects that break the supersymmetric equivalence of\ngauge boson couplings $g_i$ and gaugino couplings $h_i$ through supersymmetric\nanalogues of the oblique corrections. Working within well-motivated theoretical\nframeworks, we find that multi-TeV scale supersymmetric particles produce\ndeviations at the 1-10% level in the ratios $h_i/g_i$. Such effects allow one\nto bound the scale of kinematically inaccessible superpartners through\nprecision measurements of processes involving the accessible superparticles.\nAlternatively, if all superpartners are found, significant deviations imply the\nexistence of highly split exotic supermultiplets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 1997 21:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
