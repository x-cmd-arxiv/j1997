At a given location, star formation is assumed\nto occur when the gas velocity dispersion falls below a critical value\ndependent on the density.

We first point out that such hadron colliders will\nbecome the ``neutralino factory'' producing 10^6--10^9 neutralinos/yr, if\ngluinos and/or squarks actually exist below O(1) TeV. The lightest neutralino\n(\\neu), usually assumed to be stable, will be unstable if lighter\nsuperparticles such as the gravitino (\\gra) or axino (\\axi) exist, or R-parity\nis not conserved. The decay signal would, however, be missed in usual collider\nexperiments, particularly when the decay mostly occurs outside the detector. In\norder to search for such a slow decay of \\neu, we propose a dedicated\nexperiment where the collision products are dumped by a thick shield, which is\nfollowed by a long decay tunnel. The decay product of \\neu can be detected by a\ndetector located at the end of the tunnel. The slow arrival time and the large\noff angle (to the direction of the interaction point) of the decay product will\nprovide a clear signature of slowly decaying \\neu's.

In the first case, the properties of the allowed final states are\nsimilar to relativistic kinematics, as long as the relevant wave vectors are\nmuch smaller than the critical wave vector scale $a^{-1}$ .
