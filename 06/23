The dominant observed phenomenon is an oscillatory behavior\nthat is analogous to the 3 minute oscillations seen in Ca II lines. The\noscillations appear to be coherent over 3-8\". At any time they occur over\napprox. 50 % of the area studied, and they appear as large perturbations in the\nintensities of lines and continua. The oscillations are most clearly seen in\nintensity variations in the UV (lambda > 912 A) continua, and they are also\nseen in the intensities and velocities of chromospheric lines of C I, N I and O\nI. Intensity brightenings are accompanied by blueshifts of typically 5 km\ns$^{-1}$. Phase differences between continuum and line intensities also\nindicate the presence of upward propagating waves. Three minute intensity\noscillations are occasionally seen in second spectra (C II 1335), but never in\nthird spectra (C III and Si III).

We construct a subset of\nstates whose the minimum bound of position -momentum uncertainty (equivalent to\nan effective $\\hbar$) vanishes. The classical regime, contrary to standard\nQuantum Mechanical Systems of particles and fields, but also of strings and\nbranes appears in short distances of the order of the lattice spacing. {}For\nlinear quantum maps of long periods, we observe that time evolution leads to\nfast decorrelation of the wave packets, phenomenon similar to the behavior of\nwave packets in t' Hooft and Susskind holographic picture. Moreoever, we\nconstruct explicitly a non - dispersive basis of states in accordance with t'\nHooft's arguments about the deterministic behavior of FQM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 1997 10:06:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 1997 08:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The picture that emerges is that a\nwell-defined quantum state does not give rise to a black hole even if the\napparent distribution of energy, momenta, charges, etc. would predict one on\nclassical grounds. Indeed, geometry - general relativistic space time\ndescription - is unwarranted at the quantum microstate level. It is the\ndecoherence leading to macrostates (average over degenerate microstates) that\nprovides - on the same token - the loss of quantum coherence, the emergence of\na space time description with causal properties and, thus, the formation of a\nblack hole and its Hawking evaporation\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 1997 13:26:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 1998 16:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
