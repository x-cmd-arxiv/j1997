The\nsource flared dramatically during the first day, with an increase by a factor\n~2.2 in an hour and a half.

In contrast to the approach by St\\\"uckelberg where ghost fields\nare introduced to maintain manifest Lorentz covariance, we use reduced phase\nspace quantization with nonlocal dynamical variables which in the massless\nlimit smoothly turn into the photons, and check explicitly that the Poincare\nalgebra is fullfilled. In contrast to conventional covariant quantization our\napproach leads to a propagator which has no singularity in the massless limit\nand is well behaved for large momenta. For massive QED, where the vector field\nis coupled to a conserved fermion current, the quantum theory of the nonlocal\nvector fields is shown to be equivalent to that of the standard local vector\nfields. An inequivalent theory, however, is obtained when the reduced nonlocal\nmassive vector field is coupled to a nonconserved classical current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 1997 13:17:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 1998 15:56:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 1998 21:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
