Such transformations are labelled by some colour parameters, taking\nvalues in a colour set $\\cal C$. We show that various classes of Hopf algebras,\nsuch as almost cocommutative, coboundary, quasitriangular, and triangular ones,\ncan be extended into corresponding coloured algebraic structures, and that\ncoloured quasitriangular Hopf algebras, in particular, are characterized by the\nexistence of a coloured universal $\\cal R$-matrix, satisfying the coloured\nYang-Baxter equation. The present definitions extend those previously\nintroduced by Ohtsuki, which correspond to some substructures in those cases\nwhere the colour group is abelian. We apply the new concepts to construct\ncoloured quantum universal enveloping algebras of both semisimple and\nnonsemisimple Lie algebras, considering several examples with fixed or varying\nparameters. As a by-product, some of the matrix representations of coloured\nuniversal $\\cal R$-matrices, derived in the present paper, provide new\nsolutions of the coloured Yang-Baxter equation, which might be of interest in\nthe context of integrable models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 1997 13:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
