The relativistic mass of the particle remains within a small volume\nsurrounding a singularity moving along the particle trajectory. The singularity\nis the source of an electric displacement field. The field induces a\npolarization charge in the vacuum and this charge is equated with the charge of\nthe particle. Under dynamic conditions a distributed charge density rho(x,t) is\ninduced in the vacuum. The volume integral of the charge density is equal to\nthe charge of the particle and is rigorously conserved. The charge density is\nderived from a complex-valued physical field psi(x,t) such that rho(x,t) =\n|psi(x,t)|^2. The position probability density is equated with the mean charge\ndensity. The mean field psi(x,t) for many sample realizations with a given\nenergy E and potential V(x) is the sum of the individual fields. In order for\nthe sum to be non-zero, the components in the spectral decompositions of the\nindividual fields must be spatially coherent. The particle has a spin frequency\ngiven by Planck's relation hv = T - V + mc^2, where T is the kinetic energy,\ndetermined from the momentum p and V is a quantum potential such that E = T + V\nis conserved. The instantaneous phase of the spin is given by the phase of\nexp(ikx) in the spectral decomposition a(k) of psi(x,t). It is spatially\ncoherent, due to the dependence on x. The momentum probability distribution is\ngiven by the squared magnitude of the coefficients a(k). The Schrodinger\nequation is derived by requiring local conservation of mean energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 1997 19:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
