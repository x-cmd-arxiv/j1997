These spectra reveal the density, temperature, and metal\nabundances of the line-emitting gas. The abundances are roughly half-solar, and\ndust produces an extinction of at least a magnitude in V. The absence of [O\nIII] 4363 emission rules out shocks as a major ionizing mechanism, and the\nweakness of He II 4686 rules out a hard ionizing source, such as an active\ngalactic nucleus or cooling intracluster gas. Hot stars are therefore the best\ncandidate for producing the ionization. However, even the hottest O stars\ncannot power a nebula as hot as the one we see. Some other nonionizing source\nof heat appears to contribute a comparable amount of power. We show that the\nenergy flux from a confining medium can become important when the ionization\nlevel of a nebula drops to the low levels seen in cooling-flow nebulae.
