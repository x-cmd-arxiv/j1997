This\noption is included now in conceptual design reports of the NLC, JLC and\nTESLA/SBLC projects. All the designs foresee two interaction regions: one for\ne+e- and the second for gamma-gamma, gamma-e and e^-e^- collisions. This paper\nis focused on three aspects: 1) arguments for photon colliders; 2) parameters\nof current projects; 3) ultimate luminosities and energies, new ideas. Recent\nstudies have shown that the main collision effect - coherent pair creation - is\nsuppressed at photon colliders with the energy (2E < 2 TeV) due to the beam\nrepulsion, and one can achieve, in principle, the gamma-gamma luminosity\nexceeding 10^{35} cm^-2s^-1. The required electron beams with very small\nemittances can be obtained, for example, using a laser cooling of electron\nbeams. This new method requires a laser with a power by one order of magnitude\nhigher than that required for the ``conversion'' of electrons to photons. Such\nlasers are not available today, but hopefully they will appear by the time when\nlinear colliders will be built. High energy gamma-gamma, gamma-e colliders with\nthe luminosity comparable to that in e^+e^- collisions are beyond the\ncompetition in study of many phenomena of particle physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 1997 09:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
