We demonstrate using hydrodynamic simulations of\ngalaxy formation in a cosmological context that irregular protogalactic clumps\ncan reproduce the observed velocity width distribution and asymmetries of the\nabsorption profiles equally well. The velocity broadening in the simulated\nclumps is due to a mixture of rotation, random motions, infall and merging. The\nobserved velocity width correlates with the virial velocity of the dark matter\nhalo of the forming protogalactic clump (v_{wid} ~ 0.6 times v_{vir} for the\nmedian values with a large scatter of order a factor two between different\nlines-of-sight).
