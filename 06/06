A potential\ndifficulty with both such approaches is that the density parameter $\\Omega_0$\nis obtained only in the combination $\\beta = \\Omega_0^{0.6}/b$, if linear\nperturbation theory is used. The determination of the density parameter\n$\\Omega_0$ is therefore compromised by the lack of a good measurement of the\nbias parameter $b$, which relates the clustering of sample galaxies to the\nclustering of mass.\n  In this paper, we develop an idea of Fry (1994), using second-order\nperturbation theory to investigate how to measure the bias parameter on large\nscales.

We study these problems by adopting\nthe viewpoint that they arise mostly due to our limited calculational power,\nlittle knowledge of the vacuum structure, and an inappropriate treatment of\ngaugino condensation. It turns out that these problems can be solved or are\nmuch less severe after a more consistent and complete treatment. There are two\nkinds of non-perturbative effects in the construction of effective field\ntheory: the field-theoretical non-perturbative effects of gaugino condensation\n(with a constraint ignored in the past) and the stringy non-perturbative\neffects conjectured by Shenker, which are best described using the linear\nmultiplet formalism. Stringy non-perturbative corrections to the K\\\"ahler\npotential are invoked to stabilize the dilaton at a value compatible with a\nweak coupling regime. Modular invariance is ensured through the Green-Schwarz\ncounterterm and string threshold corrections which, together with hidden matter\ncondensation, lead to moduli stabilization at the self-dual point where the\nvev's of moduli's F-components vanish.
