Because of this shift,\nIshimaru & Arimoto conclude that >50% of the ICM iron must have originated from\nwithin Type Ia SNe progenitors. A point not appreciated in their study, nor in\nmost previous analyses, is the crucial dependence of such a conclusion upon the\nadopted massive star physics. Employing several alternative Type II SN yield\ncompilations, we demonstrate how uncertainties in the treatment of convection\nand mass-loss can radically alter our perception of the relative importance of\nType Ia and II SNe as ICM polluters. If mass-loss of the form favoured by\nMaeder (1992, A&A, 264, 105) or convection of the form favoured by Arnett\n(1996, Supernovae and Nucleosynthesis) is assumed, the effect upon the oxygen\nyields would lead us to conclude that Type Ia SNe play no part in polluting the\nICM, in contradiction with Ishimaru & Arimoto. Apparent dichotomies still exist\n(e.g. the mean ICM neon-to-iron ratio implies a 100% Type II Fe origin, while\nthe mean sulphur ratio indicates a 100% Type Ia origin) that cannot be\nreconciled with the currently available yield tables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jun 1997 06:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Comparisons among three GRB with counterparts (or upper\nlimits on them) establishes that GRB are not all scaled versions of similar\nevents. The angular size inferred from the apparent observation of\nself-absorption in the radio spectrum of GRB970508 a week later implies that\nits expansion had slowed to semi-relativistic speeds.

The spectral flow of fermions through the nodes\nduring the vortex motion leads to creation of the fermionic charge from the\nsuperfluid vacuum and to transfer of the superfluid linear momentum into the\nheat bath, thus producing an extra force on the vortex, which in some cases\ncompensates the Magnus force.

As\nconcrete examples, we construct the positive (negative) parts of the quantized\nuniversal enveloping algebras of type A_n and M_{p,q,e}(n,K), which is a\nnon-standard quantum deformation of GL(n). In particular, we get, for both\nalgebras, a unified proof of the Poincar\\'e-Birkhoff-Witt theorem and we show\nthat they are genuine universal enveloping algebras of certain generalized Lie\nalgebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jun 1997 05:30:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 1997 05:46:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 1997 08:47:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 1998 16:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
