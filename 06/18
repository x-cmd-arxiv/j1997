Given a situation\nwhich includes randomness, CB nets are used to calculate the probabilities of\nvarious hypotheses about the situation, conditioned on the available evidence.\nWe introduce a new class of networks, which we call Quantum Bayesian (QB) nets,\nthat generalize CB nets to the quantum mechanical regime. We explain how to use\nQB nets to calculate quantum mechanical conditional probabilities (in case of\neither sharp or fuzzy observations), and discuss the connection of QB nets to\nFeynman Path integrals. We give examples of QB nets that involve a single\nspin-half particle passing through a configuration of two or three\nStern-Gerlach magnets. For the examples given, we present the numerical values\nof various conditional probabilities, as calculated by a general computer\nprogram especially written for this purpose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 1997 20:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
