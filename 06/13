On\nthe experimental side these predictions have so far eluded observation,\nessentially due to the difficulty of embedding atoms in a 4 pi squeezed vacuum.\nIn this paper we show how to ``engineer'' a squeezed-bath-type interaction for\nan effective two-level system. In the simplest example, our two-level atom is\nrepresented by the two ground levels of an atom with angular momentum J=1/2 ->\nJ=1/2 transition (a four level system) which is driven by (weak) laser fields\nand coupled to the vacuum reservoir of radiation modes. Interference between\nthe spontaneous emission channels in optical pumping leads to a squeezed bath\ntype coupling, and thus to symmetry breaking of decay on the Bloch sphere. With\nthis system it should be possible to observe the effects predicted in the\ncontext of squeezed bath - atom interactions. The laser parameters allow one to\nchoose properties of the squeezed bath interaction, such as the (effective)\nphoton number expectation number N and the squeezing phase phi. We present\nresults of a detailed analytical and numerical study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 1997 13:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
