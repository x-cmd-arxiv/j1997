Besides, Nova Muscae shows a spectrum which is consistent\nwith Comptonization by a thermal plasma kT<100 keV in its hard X-ray part,\nwhile a relatively narrow annihilation line observed by SIGMA on January 20-21,\n1991 implies that positrons annihilate in a much colder medium.\n  We estimate the electron number density and the size of the emitting regions\nsuggesting that annihilation features observed by SIGMA from Nova Muscae and 1E\n1740.7-2942 are due to the positron slowing down and annihilation in thermal\nplasma. We show that in the case of Nova Muscae the observed radiation is\ncoming from a pair plasma stream, N(e+)~N(e-), rather than from a gas cloud. We\nargue that two models are probably relevant to the 1E source: annihilation in\n(hydrogen) plasma N(e+)<~N(e-) at rest, and annihilation in the pair plasma\nstream, which involves matter from the source environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 1997 13:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}
