The arc\nhas a surface brightness weighted axis ratio of 1:7, is marginally resolved in\nwidth and about 3 arcsec long. Its counterimage was identified and found to be\nvery compact r(1/2) = 2.4-4.0 / h50 kpc in a q0=0.05 cosmology). In addition,\nwe found three further multiple image systems, one with five and two with three\nimages each. The positions of the multiple images is explained by modelling the\nlight deflection caused by the cluster and the cD-galaxy with elliptical\nisothermal potentials. Since the multiple images are within 8 arcsec around the\ncD galaxy, a cluster core radius - cluster velocity dispersion degeneracy\narises. The cluster velocity dispersion and the core radius are limited to\n540-670 km/s and 5 arcsec - 11\\arcsec, respectively, and the brightness of the\nunlensed counterimage of cB58 is about 23.9 +- 0.3 (R-band), corresponding to a\nmagnification and extinction corrected restframe-B band absolute magnitude of\n-24.75 +- 0.7 mag.

In this paper, we examine the properties of an Abelian\nHiggs vortex in the presence of a charged black hole as we allow the hole to\napproach extremality. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we show\nthat the magnetic field lines (as well as the scalar field) of the vortex are\ncompletely expelled from the black hole in the extreme limit. This was to be\nexpected, since extreme black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory are known to\nexhibit such a ``Meissner effect'' in general. This would seem to imply that a\nvortex does not want to be attached to an extreme black hole. We calculate the\ntotal energy of the vortex fields in the presence of an extreme black hole.\nWhen the hole is small relative to the size of the vortex, it is energetically\nfavoured for the hole to remain inside the vortex region, contrary to the\nintuition that the hole should be expelled. However, as we allow the extreme\nhorizon radius to become very large compared to the radius of the vortex, we do\nfind evidence of an instability. This proves that it is energetically\nunfavourable for a thin vortex to interact with a large extreme black hole.\nThis would seem to dispel the notion that a black hole can support `long'\nabelian Higgs hair in the extreme limit.

The first development consists in\nworking with instantaneous eigenstates, in $a$, of the matter Hamiltonian. The\nsecond development is applied to the gravitational part of the wave function\nand generalizes the usual WKB approximation. We then obtain an exact equation\nwhich replaces the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and determines the evolution, i.e.\nthe dependence in $a$, of the coefficients of this double expansion. When\nworking in the gravitational adiabatic approximation, the simplified equation\ndelivers the unitary evolution of transition amplitudes occurring among\ninstantaneous eigenstates.

The times of\nflight of the Galileian experiments using classical test masses are replaced in\nthe quantum case by probability distributions which, although still not defined\nin an uncontroversial manner, become manifestly dependent upon the mass and the\ninitial state. Such a dependence is also expected in non inertial frames of\nreference if the weak equivalence principle still holds. This last could be\ntested, merging recent achievements in mesoscopic physics, by using cooled\natoms in free fall and accelerated frames initially prepared in nonclassical\nquantum states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 1997 22:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
