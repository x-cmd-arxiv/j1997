At a very early stage (few seconds), the\nobserved bolometric luminosity increases as t^2. On longer time scales (more\nthan about 10s), the luminosity drops as t^{-1}. If the main burst is long\nenough, an intermediate stage of constant luminosity will form. In this case,\nthe after-glow overlaps the main burst, otherwise there is a time separation\nbetween the two. On the long time scale, the flow decelerate in a self similar\nway, reaching non relativistic velocities after about 30days. Due to the\ndeceleration and the accumulation of ISM material, the relation between the\nobserved time, the shock radius, and its Lorentz factor, is given by\nt=R/16\\gamma^2c which is a factor of 8 different from the usual expression. The\nmajority of particles are those of the original ejecta (and not the ISM) up to\nabout 900s. These particles reach sub-relativistic velocities on a time scale\nof about 2hours, well before the flow becomes sub-relativistic.

A careful\ninvestigation of all classical solutions reveals that the value of the radius\nof the shell and of the radial velocity as an initial datum does not determine\nthe motion of the shell; another configuration space must, therefore, be found.\nA different problem is that the shell Hamiltonians used in literature are\ncomplicated functions of momenta (non-local) and they are gauge dependent. To\nsolve these problems, the existence is proved of a gauge invariant\nsuper-Hamiltonian that is quadratic in momenta and that generates the shell\nequations of motion. The true Hamiltonians are shown to follow from the\nsuper-Hamiltonian by a reduction procedure including a choice of gauge and\nsolution of constraint; one important step in the proof is a lemma stating that\nthe true Hamiltonians are uniquely determined (up to a canonical\ntransformation) by the equations of motion of the shell, the value of the total\nenergy of the system, and the choice of time coordinate along the shell. As an\nexample, the Kraus-Wilczek Hamiltonian is rederived from the super-Hamiltonian.\nThe super-Hamiltonian coincides with that of a fictitious particle moving in a\nfixed two-dimensional Kruskal spacetime under the influence of two effective\npotentials. The pair consisting of a point of this spacetime and a unit\ntimelike vector at the point, considered as an initial datum, determines a\nunique motion of the shell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 1997 13:29:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 1997 11:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-09"}

Total and partial photodetachment cross sections\nhave been investigated. In the former case, the residual atoms are detected\nirrespective of their excitation state, while in the latter case only those\natoms in specific states are detected. This was achieved by the use of a state\nselective detection scheme based on the resonant ionization of the residual\natoms. In addition, in the case of Li^- photodetachment, the threshold behavior\nof the Li(2 ^2P)+e^-(ks) partial cross section has been used to accurately\nmeasure the electron affinity of Li.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 1997 15:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
