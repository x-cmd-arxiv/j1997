The\ngaussian component, which we show is not due to the effects of limited\nbeam-resolution, contains more than 60% of the total flux in majority of the\ngalaxies. The dominance of the gaussian component suggests that the nuclear\nstar forming regions and the bulge stars are more important contributors to the\nemission in the two bands, rather than the outer exponential stellar disks. The\nRC profile is flatter compared to the FIR profile, resulting in a decrease of\ntheir ratio, Q60, away from the center.
