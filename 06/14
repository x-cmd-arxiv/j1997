This is a poorly known basic quantity of obvious\ninterest in vortex dynamics. The motion of a vortex causes a dipolar density\ndistortion and an associated electric field which is screened. The energy cost\nof the density distortion as well as the related screened electric field\ncontribute to the vortex mass, which is small because of efficient screening.\nAs a preliminary, we present a discussion and calculation of the vortex mass\nusing a microscopically derivable phase-only action functional for the far\nregion which shows that the contribution from the far region is negligible, and\nthat most of it arises from the (small) core region of the vortex. A\ncalculation based on a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau functional is performed\nin the core region. Unfortunately such a calculation is unreliable, the reasons\nfor it are discussed. A credible calculation of the vortex mass thus requires a\nfully microscopic, non-coarse grained theory. This is developed, and results\nare presented for a s-wave BCS like gap, with parameters appropriate to the\ncuprates. The mass, about 0.5 $m_e$ per layer, for magnetic field along the $c$\naxis, arises from deformation of quasiparticle states bound in the core, and\nscreening effects mentioned above. We discuss earlier results, possible\nextensions to d-wave symmetry, and observability of effects dependent on the\ninertial mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 1997 16:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

For such systems it is\nwell established that the standard scaling hypothesis applies, consequently the\naverage scattering intensity at wavevector _k and time t' is proportional to a\nscaling function which depends only on a rescaled time, t ~ |_k|^2 t'. We find\nthat the simulated intensities are exponentially distributed, with the\ntime-dependent average well approximated using a scaling function due to Ohta,\nJasnow, and Kawasaki.

This enabled us to extract the abelian heavy-quark\npotential from time-like Wilson loops on Polyakov gauge projected\nconfigurations. We obtained a very small string tension which is inconsistent\nwith the string tension extracted from Polyakov loop correlators. This shows\nthat the Polyakov gauge projected abelian configurations do not have a\nconsistent physical meaning. We also applied the smoothing on SU(2)\nconfigurations to test how sensitive abelian dominance in the maximal abelian\ngauge is to the short distance fluctuations. We found that on smoothed SU(2)\nconfigurations the abelian string tension was about 30% smaller than the SU(2)\nstring tension which was unaffected by smoothing. This suggests that the\napproximate abelian dominance found with the Wilson action is probably an\naccident and it has no fundamental physical relevance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jun 1997 00:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 1997 00:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The deconfinement phase transition will\ntherefore takes place sooner and it naturally results in the shortening of the\nparton phase of the plasma. The exact duration of this phase is however\nsensitive to the value of the coupling. A change from $\\a_s=0.3$ to $\\a_s=0.5$,\nfor example, reduces the lifetime of the parton phase at LHC by as much as 4.0\nfm/c. The total generated entropy is another sensitive quantity to the\ncoupling. Larger values of $\\a_s$ will lead to entropy reduction and therefore\nreduction both in the duration of the mixed phase, as well as in the final pion\nmultiplicity. It is shown that the common choice of $\\a_s=0.3$ is not a good\nvalue for the entire duration of the evolution given that the system undergoes\nsubstantial changes from the beginning to the time that the deconfinement phase\ntransition is about to take place. Instead, by using a more consistent simple\nrecipe, the system is allowed to decide its own strength of the interactions\nwhich evolves with the system as it should. With this approach, $\\a_s$\nincreases with time and this leads to acceleration in the equilibration even as\nequilibrium is near. This is opposite to the behavior of the equilibration of a\nmolecular gas or ordinary many-body system where the interaction strength is\nfixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 1997 23:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Thus, light and strange baryons should be considered as\nsystems of three constituent quarks with confining interaction and a chiral\ninteraction that is mediated by Goldstone bosons between the constituent\nquarks. We show how the flavor-spin structure and sign of the short-range part\nof the Goldstone boson exchange interaction reduces the $SU(6)_{FS}$ symmetry\ndown to $SU(3)_F \\times SU(2)_S$, induces hyperfine splittings and provides\ncorrect ordering of the lowest states with positive and negative parity.

Thus, all main ingredients of\n$NN$ interaction are implied by the chiral constituent quark model since the\nlong- and intermediate-range attraction appears in the present framework due to\npion and correlated two-pion exchanges between quarks belonging to different\nnucleons.
