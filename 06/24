All attempts to generate a fireball\npowered by neutrino-antineutrino annihilation have failed so far, and a rapid\nrotation combined with a magnetic field of $ \\sim 10^{15} $ gauss gains\npopularity.\n  In this paper a hypernova scenario is described: a collapse of a massive\nmember in a close binary system, similar to the `failed' Type Ib supernova\nmodel proposed by Woosley (1993). The collapse may lead to explosion, with\nenergy transmitted from the rapidly spinning hot neutron core or black hole to\nthe envelope by a strong magnetic field, as in a supernova model proposed by\nOstriker and Gunn (1971). However, because of a large mass and rapid rotation\nof the core the explosion of a hypernova may release up to 10^{54} erg of\nkinetic energy, creating a `dirty' fireball.\n  In this scenario a moderately non-spherical explosion may accelerate a very\nsmall fraction of matter to a very large Lorentz factor, and this may give rise\nto a gamma-ray burst and its afterglow, just like in a conventional fireball\nmodel. However, the highest velocity ejecta from a hypernova are followed with\nmatter which expands less rapidly but carries the bulk of kinetic energy,\nproviding a long term power source for the afterglow.

We do this by\ndiscretizing the chaotic component on the Surface-of-Section in a (large)\nnumber $N$ of simplectically equally big cells (in the sense of equal relative\ninvariant ergodic measure, normalized so that the total measure of the chaotic\ncomponent is unity). By iterating the transition of the chaotic orbit through\nSOS, where $j$ counts the number of iteration (discrete time), and assuming\ncomplete lack of correlations even between consecutive crossings (which can be\njustified due to the very large Lyapunov exponents), we show the universal\napproach of the relative measure of the occupied cells, denoted by $\\rho(j)$,\nto the asymptotic value of unity, in the following way: $\\rho(j) = 1 -\n(1-\\frac{1}{N})^j$, so that in the limit of big $N$, $N\\to \\infty$, we have,\nfor $j/N$ fixed, the exponential law $\\rho(j) \\approx 1 - \\exp (-j/N)$.
