The color of the sky is $B-V$ = 0.930 and does not change\ndiscernibly over the course of the sunspot cycle.

Observations of stellar winds and other gas flows in its vicinity\nsuggest a mass accretion rate approximately few x 10^{-6} solar masses per\nyear.

The spectrum of Sgr A* is\nunusual, with emission extending over many decades of wavelength. We present a\nmodel of Sgr A* which is based on a two-temperature optically-thin\nadvection-dominated accretion flow. The model is consistent with the estimated\nmass and accretion rate, and fits the observed fluxes in the cm/mm and X-ray\nbands as well as upper limits in the sub-mm and infrared bands; the fit is less\ngood in the radio below 86 GHz and in gamma-rays above 100 MeV. The very low\nluminosity of Sgr A* is explained naturally in the model by means of advection.\nMost of the viscously dissipated energy is advected into the central mass by\nthe accreting gas, and therefore the radiative efficiency is extremely low,\napproximately 5 x 10^{-6}. A critical element of the model is the presence of\nan event horizon at the center which swallows the advected energy. The success\nof the model could thus be viewed as confirmation that Sgr A* is a black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 1997 20:15:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 1997 15:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Starting from\na beta-strand conformation or two different loop conformations of the protein\nglutamine synthetase, six trajectories are generated using the so-called window\nmove in dihedral angle space. This move changes conformations locally and leads\nto realistic, quasi-continuously evolving trajectories. Four of the six\ntrajectories end in stable native-like conformations. Their folding pathways\nshow a fast initial development of a helix-bend-helix motif, followed by a\ndynamic behaviour predicted by the diffusion-collision model of Karplus and\nWeaver. The phenomenology of the pathways is consistent with experimental\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 1997 20:16:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
