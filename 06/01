This hot dense flow intercepts soft photons from a cold Keplerian disk\nand reprocesses them to form high energy X-rays and gamma rays. We study the\nspectral properties of various models of accretion disks where a Keplerian disk\non the equatorial plane may or may not be flanked by a sub-Keplerian disk and\nthe sub-Keplerian flow may or may not possess standing shocks. From comparison\nwith the spectra, we believe that the observed properties could be explained\nbetter when both the components (Keplerian and sub-Keplerian) are\nsimultaneously present close to a black hole, even though the sub-Keplerian\nhalo component may have been produced out of the Keplerian disk itself at\nlarger radii. We are able to understand soft and hard states of black hole\ncandidates, properties of X-ray novae outbursts, and quasi-periodic\noscillations of black hole candidates using these two component models. We fit\nspectra of X-ray novae GS1124-68 and GS2000+25 and satisfactorily reproduce the\nlight curves of these objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jun 1997 15:09:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

In particular, we\ndescribe the Least-Cost Flaw Repair (LCFR) strategy developed and analyzed by\nJoslin and Pollack (1994), and compare it with other strategies, including\nGerevini and Schubert's (1996) ZLIFO strategy. LCFR and ZLIFO make very\ndifferent, and apparently conflicting claims about the most effective way to\nreduce search-space size in POCL planning. We resolve this conflict, arguing\nthat much of the benefit that Gerevini and Schubert ascribe to the LIFO\ncomponent of their ZLIFO strategy is better attributed to other causes. We show\nthat for many problems, a strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with\nthe delay of separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size,\nand will do so without excessive computational overhead. Although such a\nstrategy thus provides a good default, we also show that certain domain\ncharacteristics may reduce its effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jun 1997 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
