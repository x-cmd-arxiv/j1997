The\nspectrum, which has a resolution of FWHM = 150 km/s and S/N ~ 100:1, is\nadequate for detection of weak Ly alpha clouds with equivalent width as low as\n50 mA (4sigma) with complete spectral coverage from z_(abs) = 0.03 to z(abs) =\n0.26. In this paper we present some preliminary results of this study including\nthe following. (1) The absorption profiles of three out of the four strongest\nextragalactic Ly alpha lines show complex component structure with a main\nstrong component and several weaker outlying components spanning a full\nvelocity range of ~1000-1500 km/s. The two-point correlation function does not\nshow any evidence of Ly alpha cloud clustering but suffers from small number\nstatistics. (2) Extragalactic O VI is clearly detected in the intervening\nabsorption system at z_(abs) = 0.225. Two galaxies at z = 0.2256 and z = 0.2263\nare close to the sight line (the closer galaxy is at a projected distance of\n~90 kpc), so this O VI absorption could be due to the intracluster medium of a\ngroup of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jun 1997 19:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
