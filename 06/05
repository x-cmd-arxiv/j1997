We assume the gases ejected from stars do not mix globally with the\ncircumferential gas. The ejected gas components evolve separately according to\ntheir birth time, position, and origin. We consider cases where supernova\nremnants (SNRs) mix with local ISM. The components with high metal abundance\nand/or high density cool and drop out of the hot ISM gas faster than the other\ncomponents because of their high metal abundance and/or density. This makes the\naverage metal abundance of the hot ISM low. Furthermore, since the metal\nabundance of mass-loss gas decreases with radius, gas inflow from outer region\nmakes the average metal abundance of the hot ISM smaller than that of mass-loss\ngas in the inner region. As gas ejection rate of stellar system decreases, mass\nfraction of mass-loss gas ejected at outer region increases in a galaxy. If the\nmixing of SNRs is ineffective, our model predicts that observed [Si/Fe] and\n[Mg/Fe] should decrease towards the galactic center because of strong iron\nemission by SNRs. In the outer region, where the cooling of time of the ISM is\nlong, the selective cooling is ineffective and most of gas components remain\nhot.

Hence, the latter one has\nto be the functional derivative of the effective action with respect to the\nbackground field. This is of crucial importance in theories in which the\nsymmetry breaking is due to radiative corrections. Usually the effective\npotential is considered only, neglecting the corrections due to the derivative\nterms of the effective action.
