The net result is that a meaningful comparison of the\nclustering strength of different morphological types can be performed only in\nreal space, i.e., after projecting out the redshift distortions on the\ntwo-point correlation function xi(r_p,pi).

At low energy the correlations are\nequally strong, but more complicated; they are a consequence of the Pauli\nblocking of the nucleon-nucleon collisions, the geometry, and the excitation\nenergy. Studying a second set of time-dependent variables (radii,\ndensities,...), we investigate in details how those correlations survive the\nreaction especially in central reactions where the nucleons have to pass\nthrough the whole system. It appears that some fragments are made of nucleons\nwhich were initially correlated, whereas others are formed by nucleons\nscattered during the reaction into the vicinity of a group of previously\ncorrelated nucleons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jun 1997 22:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The specific case of\nuniformly accelerated motion is particularly interesting, in connection with\nthe much debated question of the appearance of vacuum in accelerated frames.\nThe choice of Rindler representation, commonly used in General Relativity,\ntransforms vacuum fluctuations into thermal fluctuations, raising difficulties\nof interpretation. In contrast, the conformal representation of uniformly\naccelerated frames fits the symmetry properties of field propagation and\nquantum vacuum and thus leads to extend the principle of relativity of motion\nto uniform accelerations.\n  Mirrors moving in vacuum with a non uniform acceleration are known to\nradiate. The associated radiation reaction force is directly connected to\nfluctuating forces felt by motionless mirrors through fluctuation-dissipation\nrelations. Scatterers in vacuum undergo a quantum Brownian motion which\ndescribes irreducible quantum fluctuations. Vacuum fluctuations impose ultimate\nlimitations on measurements of position in space-time, and thus challenge the\nvery concept of space-time localisation within a quantum framework.\n  For test masses greater than Planck mass, the ultimate limit in localisation\nis determined by gravitational vacuum fluctuations. Not only positions in\nspace-time, but also geodesic distances, behave as quantum variables,\nreflecting the necessary quantum nature of an underlying geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 1997 09:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
