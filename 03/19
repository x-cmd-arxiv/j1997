A one-gaussian best fit to this excess reduces chi-squared (for\nthe 21 bins from 500 to 920 keV) by 12.6 from 28.3 to 16.7, and the reduced\nchi-squared value from 1.41 to 0.98. Furthermore, at the 99% Confidence Level,\nthe data impose lower and upper bounds of (24, 146) respectively upon the mean\nexcess pair count in this bin.

This reveals how the anisotropies and the quantum well confinement\neffects shape the correlations and the magnitude of fluctuations in ellipticity\nand in polarization direction. According to our results all parameters used in\nthe rate equations may be obtained experimentally from precise time resolved\nmeasurements of the intensity and polarization fluctuations in the emitted\nlaser light.
