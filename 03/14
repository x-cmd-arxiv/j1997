Introducing a\nscalar auxiliary field and adding its kinetic term, we obtain a constraint on\nthe longitudinal zero mode of the scalar field. This zero-mode constraint is\nsolved by using the $1/N$ expansion. In the leading order, we find a nontrivial\nsolution which gives the fermion nonzero mass and thus breaks the discrete\nsymmetry of the model. It is essential for obtaining the nontrivial solution to\ntreat adequately an infrared divergence which appears in the continuum limit.\nWe also discuss the constituent picture of the model. The Fock vacuum is\ntrivial and an eigenstate of the light-cone Hamiltonian. In the large $N$\nlimit, the Hamiltonian consists of the kinetic term of the fermion with dressed\nmass and the interaction term of these fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 1997 15:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
