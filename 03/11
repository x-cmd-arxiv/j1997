Neutrino\ninteractions with nonrelativistic nucleons are mainly governed by the dynamical\nstructure function for the nucleon spin density which describes its\nfluctuations. It has recently been shown that these fluctuations give rise to a\nnew mode of energy transfer between neutrinos and nucleons which inside the\nneutrinosphere is of comparable or greater importance than ordinary recoil. We\ncalculate numerically the spin density structure function in the limit of a\ndilute, non-degenerate medium from exact two-nucleon wave functions for some\nrepresentative nuclear interaction potentials. We show that spectrum and\nmagnitude of the energy transfer can deviate significantly from those based on\nthe Born approximation.

We present here various\nmodels where GYU is obtained by requiring the principles of finiteness and\nreduction of couplings. We examine the consequences of these requirements for\nthe low energy parameters, especially for the top quark mass. The predictions\nare such that they clearly distinguish already GYU from ordinary GUTs. It is\nexpected that it will be possible to discriminate among the various GYUs when\nmore accurate measurements of the top quark mass are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 1997 00:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-02"}
