During spin-down, the torque becomes more\nnegative as the luminosity increases (assuming that the 20-60 keV pulsed flux\ntraces bolometric luminosity), the opposite of what is predicted by standard\naccretion torque theory. No changes in the shape of the 20-100 keV pulsed\nenergy spectrum were detected, so that a very drastic change in the spectrum\nbelow 20 keV or the pulsed fraction would be required to make the 20-60 keV\npulsed flux a poor luminosity tracer. These are the first observations which\nflatly contradict standard magnetic disk accretion theory, and they may have\nimportant implications for understanding the spin evolution of X-ray binaries,\ncataclysmic variables, and protostars.

We find that the production cross sections may be 4 to 41 fermi-bar in\nthe future LHC pp collider with these parameters. The calculation also shows\nthat this pair production process is not sensitive to the neutral Higgs masses,\ntherefore its measurment could not give more imformations about the neutral\nHiggs bosons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 1997 13:10:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 1997 13:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
