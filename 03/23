In order to give a more elaborate\ndescription we introduce an angular correlation function, which takes into\naccount the direction of the local growth of the branches of the cascades. It\nis demonstrated that the angular correlation function gives a quantitative\ndescription of the directionality and the interrelation of branches. The power\nlaw decay of the angular correlation is evidenced and characterized by an\nexponent and an angular correlation length different from the radius of\ngyration. It is demonstrated that the overlapping of subcascades has a strong\neffect on the angular correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Mar 1997 16:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Quantum coherence at low temperatures and\nrandomness of microscopic details can cause large fluctuations of physical\nquantities. In such mesoscopic systems a localization-delocalization transition\ncan occur which forms a critical phenomenon. Accordingly, a one-parameter\nscaling theory was formulated stressing the role of conductance as the\n(one-parameter) scaling variable. However, the notion of an order parameter was\nnot fully clarified in this theory. Based on presently available analytical and\nnumerical results we focus here on the description of the total distribution\nfunctions and their flow with increasing system size. Still, one-parameter\nscaling theory does work in terms of typical values of the local density of\nstates and of the conductance which serve as order parameter and scaling\nvariable of the localization-delocalization transition, respectively. Below a\ncertain length scale, $\\xi_c$, related to the value of the typical conductance,\nlocal quantities are multifractally distributed. This multifractal behavior\nbecomes universal on approaching the localization-delocalization transition\nwith $\\xi_c$ playing the role of a correlation length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Mar 1997 00:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
