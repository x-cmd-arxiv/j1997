The\njet that is dense with respect to the external medium develops a high speed\ncore surrounded by a less dense sheath consisting of slower moving jet fluid.\nThese simulations suggest that extended extragalactic jets propagate to such\nlarge distances because they are surrounded by a lobe or cocoon whose density\nis less than the jet density.

This has been attributed to the presence\nof strong soft X-ray excesses, over the hard X-ray power law, in many\nnarrow-line Seyfert 1s. Here we use the currently available ASCA data to\nsystematically compare the harder (\\approx 2--10 keV) X-ray continua of soft\nROSAT narrow-line Seyfert 1s with those of Seyfert 1s with larger H-beta FWHM.\nOur robust and nonparametric testing suggests, with high statistical\nsignificance, that soft ROSAT narrow-line Seyfert 1s have generally steeper\nintrinsic hard X-ray continua than Seyfert 1s with larger H-beta FWHM. The hard\nphoton index trend appears similar to the previously known soft photon index\ntrend, although with a reduced photon index spread. If the soft X-ray excesses\nof all Seyfert 1s are confined to below \\approx 1 keV they cannot directly\naffect the \\approx 2--10 keV spectra studied here. However, as suggested for\nthe extreme narrow-line Seyfert 1 RE J 1034+393, a strong soft X-ray excess may\naffect the accretion disc corona which creates the underlying hard X-ray power\nlaw. If this is occurring, then more detailed study of this physical process\ncould give clues about the formation of the underlying continua of all\nSeyferts. Other effects, such as intrinsic 2--10 keV continuum curvature, could\nalso lead to the observed photon index trend and need further study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Mar 1997 19:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}
