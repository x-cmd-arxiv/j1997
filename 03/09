Given a\nconnected, complex algebraic reductive group G we show that the tensor category\nof representations of the dual group $\\check G$ is naturally equivalent to a\ncertain category of perverse sheaves on the loop Grassmannian of G. The above\nresult has been announced by Ginsburg in \\cite{G} and some of the arguments are\nborrowed from \\cite{G}. However, we use a more \"natural\" commutativity\nconstraint for the convolution product, due to Drinfeld. Secondly, we give a\ndirect geometric proof that the global cohomology functor is exact and\ndecompose this cohomology functor into a direct sum of weights. We avoid the\nuse of the decomposition theorem of \\cite{BBD} which makes our techniques\napplicable to perverse sheaves with coefficients over arbitrary commutative\nrings. This note includes sketches of (some of the) proofs. The details, as\nwell as the generalization to representations over arbitrary fields and\ncommutative rings will appear elsewhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Mar 1997 04:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
