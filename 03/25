LISA will\nmeasure simultaneously both polarization components of incoming gravitational\nwaves, so the data will consist of two time series. All physical properties of\nthe source, including its position, must be extracted from these time series.\nLISA's angular resolution is therefore not a fixed quantity, but rather depends\non the type of signal and on how much other information must be extracted.\nInformation about the source position will be encoded in the measured signal in\nthree ways: 1) through the relative amplitudes and phases of the two\npolarization components, 2) through the periodic Doppler shift imposed on the\nsignal by the detector's motion around the Sun, and 3) through the further\nmodulation of the signal caused by the detector's time-varying orientation.
