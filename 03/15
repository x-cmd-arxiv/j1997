The instabilities produce large amplitude, long-term\nvariability of a single source. We take a light curve of a single source and\ncalculate the luminosity function, from the function of time it spends at each\nluminosity. Convolving this with an assumed mass distribution we fit well the\nobserved optical luminosity function of quasars at four redshifts. As a result\nwe obtain the evolution of the mass distribution between redshifts 2.5 and 0.5.\nThe maximum of the active black hole mass function moves towards lower mass by\na factor ~10 at the low redshift. The number of high mass sources declines\nrapidly, and so low mass sources become dominant at lower redshift. The main\nconclusions are following: 1) The quasar long-term variability due to the disk\nthermal-viscous instabilities provides a natural explanation for the observed\nquasar luminosity function. 2) The peak of the mass function evolves towards\nlower black hole masses at lower redshifts by a factor ~10. 3) High mass\nsources die subsequently when redshift gets smaller. 4) The number of high mass\nsources declines rapidly, and so low mass sources become dominant at lower\nredshift. 5) The periodic outbursts of activity appear as long as the matter is\nsupplied to the accretion disk. 6) Since the time-averaged accretion rate is\nlow, the remnant sources (or sources in the low activity phase) do not grow to\nvery massive black holes. 7) A continuous fuel supply at a relatively low\naccretion rate (~0.01 - 0.1 \\dot M_{Edd}$) for each single source is required\nover the lifetime of the entire quasar population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 1997 17:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We examine\nthe phenomenon of explosive particle production due to spinodal instabilities\nand parametric amplification in expanding universes with and without symmetry\nbreaking. For a variety of initial conditions, we compute the evolution of the\ninflaton, its quantum fluctuations, and the equation of state. We find\nexplosive growth of quantum fluctuations, although particle production is\nsomewhat sensitive to the expansion of the universe. In the large N limit for\nsymmetry breaking scenarios, we determine generic late time solutions for any\nflat Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmology. We also present a complete and\nnumerically implementable renormalization scheme for the equation of motion and\nthe energy momentum tensor in flat FRW cosmologies. In this scheme the\nrenormalization constants are independent of time and of the initial\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 1997 17:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
