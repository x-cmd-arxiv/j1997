Monochromatic\nadiabatic waves, due to unbalanced heating, generate continuously rising\nchromospheric temperature plateaus in which the low frequency resonances\nquickly die out. All non-adiabatic calculations lead to stable mean\nchromospheric temperature distributions determined by shock dissipation and\nradiative cooling. For non-adiabatic monochromatic wave excitation, a critical\nfrequency f_cr ~ 1/25 Hz is confirmed, which separates domains of different\nresonance behaviour. For waves of frequency f < f_cr, the resonances decay,\nwhile for waves of f > f_cr persistent resonance oscillations occur, which are\nperpetuated by shock merging. Excitation with acoustic frequency spectra\nproduces distinct dynamical mean chromosphere models where the detailed\ntemperature distributions depend on the shape of the assumed spectra. The\nstochasticity of the spectra and the ongoing shock merging lead to a persistent\nresonance behaviour of the atmosphere. The acoustic spectra show a distinct\nshape evolution with height such that at great height a pure 3 min band becomes\nincreasingly dominant. With our Eulerian code we did not find appreciable mass\nflows at the top boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 1997 16:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is found that, as opposed to\nelectrostatic disorder, the energy levels of localized electrons shift upward\nwith a rate of order O(1/B_0) when B_0 is decreased, while the extended states\nremain static at the same order. Therefore, there is no indication that the\nextended states will float out of the Fermi energy and induce a metal-insulator\ntransition as the magnetic disorder is increased.

If one of the\neffects of quantizing gravity is to introduce a minimum length scale $L_P$ in\nthe spacetime, then one would expect the segments of paths with lengths less\nthan $L_P$ to be suppressed in the path integral. Assuming that the path\nintegral amplitude is invariant under the `duality' transformation ${\\cal R}\\to\nL_P^2/R$, one can calculate the modified Feynman propagator in an arbitrary\nbackground spacetime. It turns out that the key feature of this modification is\nthe following: The proper distance $(\\Delta x)^2$ between two events, which are\ninfinitesimally separated, is replaced by $\\Delta x^2 + L_P^2$; that is the\nspacetime behaves as though it has a `zero-point length' of $L_P$. This\nequivalence suggests a deep relationship between introducing a\n`zero-point-length' to the spacetime and postulating invariance of path\nintegral amplitudes under duality transformations. In the Schwinger's proper\ntime description of the propagator, the weightage for a path with proper time s\nbecomes $m(s+L_P^2/s)$ rather than as ms. As to be expected, the ultraviolet\nbehavior of the theory is improved significantly and divergences will disappear\nif this modification is taken into account.

The uncertainty in the extraction of the\nweak phase $\\alpha$ from the measurement of the time-dependent asymmetry in\n$B^0_d \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ decays is also analyzed.

To help understand this problem, Rovelli proposed a model of a two\nharmonic oscillators system where one of the oscillators can be thought of as a\n``clock'' for the other oscillator thus giving a natural time reference frame\nfor the system. Recently, the author has constructed an explicit form for the\ncoherent states on the reduced phase space of this system in terms of Klauder's\nprojection operator approach. In this paper, by using coherent state\nrepresentations and other tools from coherent state quantization, I investigate\nthe construction of gauge invariant operators on this reduced phase space, and\nthe ability to use a quantum oscillator as a ``clock.''\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 1997 23:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
