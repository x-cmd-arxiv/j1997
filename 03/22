This model allows us to follow the\nquasi-static evolution of the cloud's core prior to collapse and the subsequent\nevolution of the remaining envelope. By neglecting the thermal pressure\ngradients in comparison with magnetic stresses and by assuming that the ion\nvelocity is small compared with the neutral velocity, we are able to find exact\nanalytic solutions to the MHD equations. We show that, in the case of a\ncentrally condensed cloud, a core of finite mass collapses into the origin\nleaving behind a quasi-static envelope, whereas initially homogeneous clouds\nnever develop any structure in the absence of thermal stresses, and collapse as\na whole. Prior to the collapse of the core, the cloud's evolution is\ncharacterized by two phases: a long, quasi-static phase where the relevant\ntimescale is the ambipolar diffusion time (treated in this paper), and a short,\ndynamical phase where the characteristic timescale is the free-fall time. The\ncollapse of the core is an \"outside-in\" collapse. The quasi-static evolution\nterminates when the cloud becomes magnetically supercritical; thereafter its\nevolution is dynamical, and a singularity develops at the origin-a protostar.\nAfter the initial formation of the protostar, the outer envelope continues to\nevolve quasi-statically, while the region of dynamical infall grows with\ntime-an \"inside-out\" collapse. We use our solution to estimate the magnetic\nflux trapped in the collapsing core and the mass accretion rate onto the newly\nformed protostar.

One model is the WAM model, in combination with an\noptimal interpolation method (OIP). The other model, DASWAM, consists of the\nthird generation wave model PHIDIAS in combination with an approximate\nimplementation of the adjoint method.\n  In an experiment over the period February 19 - March 30, 1993, the models are\ndriven by the same wind field (HIRLAM analysis winds), and the same observation\ndata set is assimilated. This set consists of a) spectra from three\npitch-and-roll buoys and b) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) spectra from the\nERS-1 satellite. Three analysis/forecast runs are performed: one without\nassimilation, one with assimilation of buoy measurements only, and one with all\ndata assimilated. For validation, observations from four buoys, altimeter data\nfrom ERS-1 and Topex-Poseidon, and scatterometer data from ERS-1 are used.\n  A detailed analysis of the \"Wadden Storm\" (February 20-22) shows the very\ndifferent nature of the two assimilation schemes: the wave and wind field\ncorrections of the WAM/OIP scheme are all in the vicinity of the observations,\nwhereas the DASWAM adjustments are more of a global nature. The impact of some\nindividual buoy and SAR observations is visualized. A comparison of the\nperformance of the two schemes is somewhat obscured by the very different\nbehaviour of the two first-guess runs.\n  A statistical analysis over the whole 39-day period gives the following\nresults.
