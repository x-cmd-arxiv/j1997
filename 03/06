The shape of the\nlines varied subtly; there was an interval during which the variation in the\nratio of the fluxes of the two peaks appeared to be sinusoidal, with a period\nof 2.16 years and an amplitude of about 16% of the average value. The variable\npart of the broad H-alpha line is well fit by a model in which a region of\nexcess emission (a quiescent ``hot spot'') within an accretion disk (fitted to\nthe non-varying portion of the double-peaked line) completes at least two\ncircular orbits and eventually fades. Fits to spectra from epochs when the hot\nspot is not present allow determination of the disk inclination, while fits for\nepochs when it is present provide a measurement of the radius of the hot spot's\norbit. From these data and the period of variation, we find that the mass\nwithin the hot spot's orbit is 2.2 +0.2/-0.7 times 10^8 solar masses, within\nthe range of previous estimates of masses of active galactic nuclei. Because\nthis mass is determined at a relatively small distance (~1000 AU) from the\ncentral body, it is extremely difficult to explain without assuming that a\nsupermassive black hole lies within Arp 102B.

Reflection is clearly detected in\nall the spectra, but its contribution is larger in the softer X-ray spectra\nseen in outburst than in quiescence. This supports models in which the\nquiescent inner disk is not present or not optically thick, so that the only\nreflector is the white dwarf surface rather than the white dwarf plus the disk.\nWe detect partially ionized absorption in the ASCA outburst spectrum, which is\nprobably the X-ray signature of the outflowing wind. The ASCA data also allow a\ndetailed measure of the elemental abundances. We find that all detectable lines\nfrom the hot plasma (except perhaps Si and S) are a factor $\\sim 2.5\\times$\nweaker than expected from solar abundances. We examine possible deviations from\ncoronal equilibrium, but conclude that the heavy elements are truly\nunderabundant in SS Cyg.\n  In quiescence the underlying intrinsic spectrum is consistent with a single\ntemperature plasma. This conflicts with the expected cooling of the material,\nand requires that either the plasma is reheated or that the cooler emission is\nmasked by absorption in an optically thin inner disk which affects only that\npart of the boundary layer emission below the disk. By contrast, the outburst\nspectrum is much softer and is dominated by the cooling components but has a\ntotal hot plasma luminosity similar to that in quiescence, showing that the\noptically thin plasma emission is important even in outburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 1997 09:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

It is well-known that the Liouville equation for a smooth, real\nfield $\\phi$ under periodic boundary condition is a reduction of the SL(2,R)\nWZNW model on the cylinder, where the WZNW field g in SL(2,R) is restricted to\nbe Gauss decomposable.
