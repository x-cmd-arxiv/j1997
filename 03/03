The flares and quiescent periods in the light curve suggest that\nthe variability is nonlinear, and a statistical test yields a detection with >6\nsigma confidence.

Thus, these results cannot be explained easily by simple models\nfor AGN variability, including shot noise which may be associated with flares\nin disk-corona models or active regions on a rotating disk, because in those\nmodels the events are independent and the variability is therefore linear.

The Virgo cluster is thereby often used as an\nimportant stepping stone. The first HST measurement of the distance of a Virgo\ngalaxy (M100) using Cepheid variables provided a value for $H_0=80(\\pm 17)$\nkm/s/Mpc (Freedman et al. 1994). This measurement was preceeded by a ground\nbased study of the Virgo spiral NGC4571 (Pierce et al. 1994) formally providing\n$H_0= 87\\pm7$ km/s/Mpc. These determinations rely on the accuracy with which\nthe position of this observed spiral galaxy can be located with respect to the\nVirgo cluster center. This uncertainty introduces a major error in the\ndetermination of $H_0$, together with the uncertainty in the adopted Virgo\ninfall velocity of the Local Group. Here we propose the use of spiral galaxies\nwhich show clear signs of being stripped off their interstellar medium by the\nintracluster gas of the Virgo cluster as targets for the Cepheid distance\nmeasurements. We show that the stripping process and the knowledge of the\nintracluster gas distribution from ROSAT X-ray observations allow us to locate\nthese galaxies with an at least three times higher precision with respect to\nM87 than in the case of other spirals like M100. The X-ray observations further\nimply that M87 is well centered within the intracluster gas halo of the Virgo\ncluster and that M86 is associated with a group of galaxies and a larger dark\nmatter halo. The combination of these informations could enable us to locate\nthe two stripped spiral galaxies quite precisely within the Virgo cluster and\ncould greatly improve the determination of the Virgo cluster distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 1997 14:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

By studying the power spectrum of the surface and its\nrelation to the height-height correlation, we distinguish two independent\ncauses for anomalous scaling. One is super-roughening (global roughness\nexponent larger than or equal to one), even if the spectrum behaves non\nanomalously. Another cause is what we term an intrinsically anomalous spectrum,\nin whose scaling an independent exponent exists, which induces different\nscaling properties for small and large length scales (that is, the surface is\nnot self-affine). In this case, the surface does not need to be super-rough in\norder to display anomalous scaling. In both cases, we show how to extract the\nindependent exponents and scaling relations from the correlation functions, and\nwe illustrate our analysis with two exactly solvable examples. One is the\nsimplest linear equation for molecular beam epitaxy , well known to display\nanomalous scaling due to super-roughening. The second example is a random\ndiffusion equation, which features anomalous scaling independent of the value\nof the global roughness exponent below or above one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 1997 11:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
