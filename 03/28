Lauer et al. 1996, ApJ, 471, L79 have shown that NGC 4486B is\nsimilar to M31 in having a double nucleus. We show that it also resembles M31\nin its kinematics. The velocity dispersion gradient is very steep: sigma\nincreases from 116 +- 6 km/s at r = 2\" - 6\" to 281 +- 11 km/s at the center.\nThis is much higher than expected for an elliptical galaxy of absolute\nmagnitude M_B = -16.8: NGC 4486B is far above the scatter in the Faber-Jackson\ncorrelation between sigma and bulge luminosity. Therefore the King core\nmass-to-light ratio, M/L_V = 20, is unusually high compared with normal values\nfor old stellar populations. We construct dynamical models with isotropic\nvelocity dispersions and show that they reproduce black hole (BH) masses\nderived by more detailed methods. We also fit axisymmetric, three-integral\nmodels. Isotropic models imply that NGC 4486B contains a central dark object,\nprobably a BH, of mass M_BH = 6^{+3}_{-2} x 10^8 M_sun.

A 6 x 10^8 M_sun BH is 9 % of the mass M_bulge\nin stars; even if M_BH is smaller than the isotropic value, M_BH/M_bulge is\nlikely to be unusually large. Double nuclei are a puzzle because the dynamical\nfriction timescales for self-gravitating star clusters in orbit around each\nother are short. Since both M31 and NGC 4486B contain central dark objects, our\nresults support models in which the survival of double nuclei is connected with\nthe presence of a BH (e. g., Tremaine 1995, AJ, 110, 628).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 1997 02:34:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

As a by-product we deduce the\nenhancement of supersymmetry as the angle approaches zero. We also comment on\nthe D-brane theory describing these new bound states, and a connection between\nthe angle and the world-volume gauge fields of the D-brane system. We use these\nconfigurations to find new embeddings of the four and five dimensional black\nholes with non-zero entropy, whose entropy now also depends on the angle and\nworld-volume gauge fields.
