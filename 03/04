The simulations\nare performed using a newly developed multi-mass scheme which combines a PM\ncode with a high resolution N-body code. Numerical effects due to time stepping\nand gravitational softening are investigated as well as the influence of the\nsimulation box size and of the assumed boundary conditions. Special emphasis is\nlaid on the formation process and the influence of various cosmological\nparameters. Cosmogonies with massive neutrinos are also considered. Differences\nbetween clusters in the same cosmological model seem to dominate over\ndifferences due differing background cosmogony. The cosmological model can\nalter the time evolution of cluster collapse, but the merging pattern remains\nfairly similar, e.g. number of mergers and mass ratio of mergers. The gross\nproperties of a halo, such as its size and total angular momentum, also evolve\nin a similar manner for all cosmogonies and can be described using analytical\nmodels. It is shown that the density distribution of a halo shows a\ncharacteristic radial dependence which follows a power law with a slope of\n$\\alpha=-1$ at small and $\\alpha=-3$ at large radii, independent of the\nbackground cosmogony or the considered redshift. The shape of the density\nprofiles follows the generic form proposed by Navarro et al. (1996) for all\nhierarchically clustering scenarios and retains very little information about\nthe formation process or the cosmological model. Only the central matter\nconcentration of a halo is correlated to the formation time and therefore to\nthe corresponding cosmogony. We emphasise the role of non-radial motions of the\nhalo particles in the evolution of the density profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 1997 18:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The phase diagram for the strongly correlated state with\nonly singly occupied sites, the weakly correlated state, where single and\ndouble occupation is allowed, and for the superconducting state, was determined\nfor any values of X and any electron concentration n. At the half-filled band\n(n=1) a direct transition from the superconductor to the Mott insulator was\nfound. In the region of strong correlations the superconducting solution is\nstable for n close to 1, in contrast to the case of weak correlations, in which\nsuperconductivity occurs at n close to 0 and n close to 2. We found also that\nstrong correlations change characteristics of the superconducting phase, e.g.\nthe gap in the excitation spectrum has a nonexponential dependence close to the\npoint of the phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 1997 12:07:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 1997 11:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
