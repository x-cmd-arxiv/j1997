In both two and three dimensions, we find that the\nmelting transition is followed at a higher temperature by the onset of large\ndissipation associated with the zero-field XY transition. It is characterized\nby the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs (in 2D) or vortex loops (in\n3D). At the upper transition, there is a sharp increase in magnetization, in\nqualitative agreement with recent local Hall probe experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Mar 1997 22:55:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 May 1997 20:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 May 1997 08:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
