Analytical dependences on radius describing an electromagnetic\nburst are derived. The time dependence of the burst shape for an infinitely\ndistant observer and the maximum energy of relativistic particles accelerated\nby an electric field are numerically calculated.\n  The objects under consideration are of particular interest because particles\nin their vicinity can be accelerated up to the Planck energies. Possible\nastrophysical applications to the theory of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and\nQSOs are briefly discussed. It is shown for the first time that a spinar can be\nproduced by a merger of neutron stars; this possibility is considered in and\nwithout connection with the formation of gamma-ray bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Mar 1997 17:31:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
