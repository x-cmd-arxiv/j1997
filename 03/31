The most\nimportant issue is that of the overall normalization of the hadronic spectral\nfunctions should not be fixed by assuming complete resonance dominance of the\ncontinuum threshold region as it can overestimate the resonance contributions\nto spectral integrals by factors as large as $\\sim 5$. The second important\nuncertainty comes from the assumed location, $s_0$, of the onset of duality\nwith perturbative QCD, as the extracted quark masses depend very sensitively on\nthis parameter. The assumption of duality and the requirement of positivity of\n$\\rho_5(s)$ imposes very severe constraints on the shape of the relevant\nspectral function in the dual region, and leads to rigorous lower bounds for\n$m_u+m_d$ as a function of $s_0$. In the extractions of $m_s$ we find that the\nconventional choice of the value of $s_0$ is not physical. For a more\nreasonable choice of $s_0$ we are not able to find a solution that is stable\nwith respect to variations of the Borel transform parameter. This problem can\nbe overcome only if the hadronic spectral function is determined up to\nsignificantly larger values of $s$ than is currently possible. Finally, we also\nestimate the error associated with the convergence of perturbative QCD\nexpressions used in the sum rule analyses. Our conclusion is that, taking all\nof these issues into account, the resulting sum rule estimates for both\n$m_u+m_d$ and $m_s$ could easily have uncertainties as large as a factor of 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Mar 1997 19:00:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 1999 18:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
