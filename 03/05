Indeed, if weakly\nrelativistic systems (such as white dwarf-white dwarf binaries) encounter a\npoint of dynamical instability at some critically close separation, coalescence\nmay be entirely a classical, hydrodynamic process. Therefore, a proper\ninvestigation of this stage of binary evolution must include three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations. We have constructed equilibrium sequences of\nsynchronously rotating, equal-mass binaries in circular orbit with a single\nparameter - the binary separation - varying along each sequence. Sequences have\nbeen constructed with various polytropic as well as realistic white dwarf and\nneutron star equations of state.
