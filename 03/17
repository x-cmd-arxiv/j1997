A\nsignificant fraction of the carbon stars still have luminosities fainter than\nthe lower LMC limit of Mbol~-3.5. A similar trend is present among some of the\ncarbon stars found in other dwarf spheroidals, but they do not reach a limit as\nfaint as Mbol~-1.4 found for the SMC. At present, the TP-AGB evolution models\ncannot explain the origin of carbon stars with Mbol>-3.5 through a single-star\nevolution scenario, even if they form immediately after entering the TP-AGB\nphase.
