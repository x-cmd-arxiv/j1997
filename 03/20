The sites of the qubits are\npermitted to have a small random variance. We derive the explicit conditions\nunder which the qubits can be assumed decohering independently. In other\ncircumstances, the qubits are decohered cooperatively. We describe two kinds of\ncollective decoherence. In each case, a scheme is proposed for reducing the\ncollective decoherence. The schemes operate by encoding the input states of the\nqubits into some ''subdecoherent'' states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 1997 02:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
