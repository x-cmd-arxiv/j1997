In this paper, we present another similarity between these\nsources. Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of GRO J1744-28 show that at\nleast 10 out of 94 bursts are followed by quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO)\nwith frequencies of about 0.4 Hz. The period of the oscillations decreases over\ntheir 30--80 s lifetime, and they occur during a spectrally hard ``shoulder''\n(or ``plateau'') which follows the burst. In one case the QPO show a modulation\nenvelope which resembles simple beating between two narrow-band oscillations at\n0.325 and 0.375 Hz. Using EXOSAT observations, Lubin et al. found QPO with\nfrequencies of 0.039 to 0.056 Hz following 10 out of 95 type II bursts from the\nRapid Burster.

This analysis requires a calculation of the probability that a\nline, if present, will be detected in a given burst.

Ginga\nreported lines at ~20 and ~40 keV whereas the low energy cutoff of the BATSE\nspectra is typically above 20 keV; hence BATSE's sensitivity to lines is less\nthan that of Ginga below 40 keV, and greater above.

Our data show clear evidence that the intrinsic continuum\npolarization of SN 1993J evolved from being essentially negligible on April\n3-4, to a peak value of ~ 1% in late April 1993, and started to decline by the\nmiddle of May. The polarized flux spectrum in late April strongly resembled\nspectra of Type Ib supernovae, with prominent He I lines but redshifted ~ 3380\nkm/s relative to the total flux spectrum. These data are consistent with models\nof Hoflich; they suggest that the polarization was most likely produced by\neither an asymmetric helium core configuration of material and/or flux, or\nscattering from an asymmetric circumstellar distribution of dusty material. A\ncombination of electron and dust scattering, as well as a clumpy or stratified\ndistribution of the emitting gas, are possible as the polarization mechanism of\nthe continuum and emission lines. The latter interpretation is supported by the\nfact that 1-2 months after the explosion, the observed rotations of\npolarization position angle across prominent line features remain even after\ncorrection for effects of interstellar polarization. This indicates that\nemission lines of He I, Fe II, [O I], and H are all intrinsically polarized at\nposition angles different from that of the continuum, with the non-Balmer lines\ngenerally being most highly polarized. If the supernova had an oblate geometry,\nour data are consistent with a small viewing angle (i.e., more or less\nequator-on), although the degree of asphericity that gave rise to the\npolarization at early times is probably smaller (minor to major axis ratio >\n0.7) than has been previously suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 1997 01:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Combining a mode prepared in\nsuch a state and a mode prepared in a photon-number state, the state of the\nmode in one of the output channels of the beam splitter ``collapses'' to a\nphoton-added state, provided that no photons are detected in the other output\nchannel. We present analytical and numerical results, with special emphasis on\nphoton-added coherent and squeezed vacuum states.
