The density of cold gas at redshifts\nz=3+-1 is obtained from the mean HI column density of DLAs per cosmological\npath length. This path length per unit redshift is in turn a sensitive function\nof the vacuum density parameter, Omega_v. We compare the total inferred mass of\ncold gas at high redshifts to that observed in stars today for flat\ncosmologies. We define \"eta\" to be net fraction of the baryonic content of\nlocal galaxies which was expelled since z=3, and use Bayesian inference to\nderive confidence regions in the (eta, Omega_v) plane. In all cosmologies we\nfind that eta<0.4 with at least 95% confidence if <25% of the current stellar\npopulation formed before z=3. The most likely value of eta is negative,\nimplying a net increase by several tens of percent in the baryonic mass of\ngalaxies since z=3+-1.

Based on our results and the\nlow metallicity observed in DLAs at z>2, we infer that more than half of the\nbaryonic mass processed through galaxies must have been assembled and partly\nexpelled from galaxies after z=2.

The collinear\nphoton initial state singularity depends logarithmically on the mass of the\nvirtual photon and is absorbed into the virtual photon structure function. An\n$\\overline{MS}$ factorization scheme is defined similarly to the real photon\ncase. Numerical results are presented for HERA conditions using the Snowmass\njet definition for inclusive single jet and dijet cross sections. We study the\ndependence of these cross sections on the transverse energies and rapidities of\nthe jets. Finally, we compare the ratio of the experimentally defined resolved\nand direct cross sections with recent ZEUS data as a function of the photon\nvirtuality $P^2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 1997 10:44:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

The\nabnormal solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (corresponding to excitations\nin the relative time-energy degree of freedom), when they exist, are recovered\nin the 3D reductions via a complicated dependence of the final potential on the\ntotal energy. We know however that the one-body (or one high mass) limit of\nsome 3D reductions of the exact Bethe-Salpeter equation leads to a compact 3D\nequation (by a mutual cancellation of the ladder and crossed graph\ncontributions), which does not exhibit this kind of dependence on the total\nenergy anymore. We conclude that the exact Bethe-Salpeter equation has no\nabnormal solution at this limit, or has only solutions for which our 3D wave\nfunction vanishes. This is in contrast with the results of the ladder\napproximation, where no such cancellation occurs. We draw the same conclusions\nfor the static model, which we obtain by letting the mass of the lighter\nparticle go also to infinity. These results support Wick's conjecture that the\nabnormal solutions are a spurious consequence of the ladder approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 1997 15:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The extension of their use to synchrotrons working\nat lower energies, where Coulomb scattering can be important and the transverse\nbeam size is large, introduces new complications considering beam heating of\nthe wire, composition of the secondary particle shower and geometrical\nconsideration in the detection set-up. A major problem in treating these\neffects is that the creation of secondaries in a thin carbon wire by a\nenergetic primary beam is difficult to describe in an analytical way. We are\nhere presenting new results from a full Monte Carlo simulation of this process\nyielding information on heat deposited in the wire, particle type and energy\nspectrum of secondaries and angular dependence as a function of primary beam\nenergy. The results are used to derive limits for the use of wire scanners in\nlow energy accelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 1997 14:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
