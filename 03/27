Only if the quantum measurement is\nfuzzy, continuous monitoring gives a readout E(t) from which information about\nthe dynamical development of the state vector of the system may be obtained in\ncertain cases. This is studied in detail. Fuzziness is thereby introduced with\nthe help of restricted path integrals equivalent to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.\nFor an otherwise undisturbed multilevel system it is shown that this\nmeasurement represents a model of decoherence. If it lasts long enough, the\nmeasurement readout discriminates between the energy levels and the von Neumann\nstate reduction is obtained. For a two-level system under resonance influence\n(which undergoes in absence of measurement Rabi oscillations between the\nlevels) different regimes of measurement are specified depending on its\nduration and fuzziness: 1) the Zeno regime where the measurement results in a\nfreezing of the transitions between the levels and 2) the Rabi regime when the\ntransitions maintain. It is shown that in the Rabi regime at the border to the\nZeno regime a correlation exists between the time dependent measurement readout\nand the modified Rabi oscillations of the state of the measured system.\nPossible realizations of continuous fuzzy measurements of energy are sketched.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 1997 19:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
