It is suggested that\nthe \"physical\" degrees of freedom, which explain the entropy $S^{BH}$, form\nonly a finite subset of the standard Rindler-like modes defined outside the\nblack hole horizon. The entropy $S_R$ of the Rindler modes, or entanglement\nentropy, is always ultraviolet divergent, while the entropy of the \"physical\"\nmodes is finite and it coincides in the induced gravity with $S^{BH}$. The two\nentropies $S^{BH}$ and $S_R$ differ by a surface integral Q interpreted as a\nNoether charge of non-minimally coupled scalar constituents of the model. We\ndemonstrate that energy E and Hamiltonian H of the fields localized in a part\nof space-time, restricted by the Killing horizon $\\Sigma$, differ by the\nquantity $T_H Q$, where $T_H$ is the temperature of a black hole. The first law\nof the black hole thermodynamics enables one to relate the probability\ndistribution of fluctuations of the black hole mass, caused by the quantum\nfluctuations of the fields, to the probability distribution of \"physical\" modes\nover energy E. The latter turns out to be different from the distribution of\nthe Rindler modes. We show that the probability distribution of the \"physical\"\ndegrees of freedom has a sharp peak at E=0 with the width proportional to the\nPlanck mass. The logarithm of number of \"physical\" states at the peak coincides\nexactly with the black hole entropy $S^{BH}$. It enables us to argue that the\nenergy distribution of the \"physical\" modes and distribution of the black hole\nmass are equivalent in the induced gravity. Finally it is shown that the\nNoether charge Q is related to the entropy of the low frequency modes\npropagating in the vicinity of the bifurcation surface $\\Sigma$ of the horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 1997 21:07:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-09"}

The unified\nrealization involves a dimension zero boson (dilaton), dimension one symmetry\ncurrents and dimension 1/2 free bosons for QSCA'a and dimension 1/2 free\nfermions for SCA's. The dimension 1/2 free bosons and fermions are associated\nwith the quaternionic and super-quaternionic symmetric spaces of corresponding\nLie groups and Lie supergroups, respectively.
