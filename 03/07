Here\nwe present new imaging Fabry-Perot observations of Circinus which confirm the\nexistence of an ionization cone in this object but also show for the first time\na complex of ionized filaments extending radially from the nucleus out to\ndistances of 1 kpc. Arcs suggestive of bow shocks are observed at the terminus\nof some of these filamentary structures. Most spectacular of all, one of the\nstructures appears to be a scaled-up version of a Herbig-Haro jet. The velocity\nfield of the filaments confirms that they represent material expelled from the\nnucleus (possibly in the form of `bullets') or entrained in a wide-angle wind\nroughly aligned with the polar axis of the galaxy. The motions observed across\nthe ionization cone are highly supersonic, so high-velocity shocks are likely\nto contribute to the ionization of the line emitting gas. However, it is not\nclear at present whether shock ionization dominates over photoionization by the\nSeyfert 2 nucleus. Extrapolation of the filaments to smaller radii comes to\nwithin 1 arcsec (about 20 pc) of the infrared nucleus, therefore suggesting a\nAGN or nuclear starburst origin to these features. The complex of radial\nfilaments detected in the Circinus galaxy is unique among active galaxies. The\nfrequency of such events is unknown since only a handful of galaxies have been\nobserved at the sensitivity level of our present observations. The event in the\nCircinus galaxy may represent a relatively common evolutionary phase in the\nlives of gas-rich active galaxies during which the dusty cocoon surrounding the\nnucleus is expelled by the action of jet or wind phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 1997 17:41:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The spectrum of the spontaneously broken theory\nwith lower supersymmetry is in one-to-one correspondence with the spectrum of\nthe heterotic N=4 string. The mass splitting of the N=4 spectrum depends on the\ncompactification moduli as well as the three R-symmetry charges. We also show\nthat, in string theory, chiral theories can be obtained after spontaneous\nbreaking of extended supersymmetry. This was impossible at the level of field\ntheory. In the large moduli limit a restoration of the N=4 supersymmetry is\nobtained. As expected the graviphotons and some of the gauge bosons become\nmassive in N=1 vacua. At some special points of the moduli space some of the\nN=4 states with non-zero winding numbers and with spin 0 and {1/2} become\nmassless chiral superfields of the unbroken N=1 supersymmetry.

In\nthis letter we suggest that the two timelike dimensions could be real, and\nbelong to two physical sectors of a single theory each containing its own\ntimelike dimension.

The n-qubit register can\nbe described by complex vector with 2^n components (it belongs to n'th tensor\npower of qubit spaces). For example, for algorithm of factorization of numbers\nby quantum computer n can be about a few hundreds for some realistic\napplications for cryptography. The applications described further are used some\nother properties of quantum systems and they do not demand such huge number of\nstates.\n  The term \"images recognition\" is used here for some broad class of problems.\nFor example, we have a set of some objects V_i and function of \"likelihood\":\n  F(V,W) < F(V,V) = 1\n  If we have some \"noisy\" or \"distorted\" image W, we can say that recognition\nof W is V_i, if F(W,V_i) is near 1 for some V_i.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 1997 01:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
