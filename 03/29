The\ncharacteristic point of this new scheme is to take the fermion field to be a\nvector in a 24-dimensional space which contains all leptons and quarks.\nCorresponding to this specification, all gauge and Higgs boson fields are\nrepresented in $24\\times 24$ matrix forms. We incorporate two Higgs doublet\nbosons $h$ and $SU(2)_R$ adjoint Higgs $\\xi_R$ which are as usual transformed\nas $(2,2^\\ast,0)$ and $(1,3,-2)$ under $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)$,\nrespectively. Owing to the revise of the algebraic rules in a new NCG, we can\nobtain the necessary potential and interacting terms between these Higgs bosons\nwhich are responsible for giving masses to the particles included. Among the\nHiggs doublet bosons, one CP-even scalar boson survives in the weak energy\nscale and other four scalar bosons acquire the mass of the $SU(2)_R\\times U(1)$\nbreaking scale, which is similar to the situation in the standard model.\n$\\xi_R$ is responsible to spontaneously break $SU(2)\\ma{R} \\times U(1)$ down to\n$U(1)\\ma{Y}$ and so well explains the seesaw mechanism. Up and down quarks have\nthe different masses through the vacuum expectation value of $h$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Mar 1997 07:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
