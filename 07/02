The HRI\nspatial resolution combined with an improved wavelet analysis method and with\ncomplementary radio and optical data provides new results compared to a\nprevious paper based on ROSAT PSPC data (Pislar et al. 1997). We use also\nredshift data in order to identify galaxies dynamically belonging to the main\nbody of the cluster and/or to superimposed substructures. Various kinds of\nemission are superimposed on a mean thermal X-ray emission due to the\nintra-cluster gas: a) an X-ray flux excess in the centre; b) a south blob,\npartially generated by individual galaxies. The mean velocity and velocity\ndispersion of the galaxies located in this region are the same as those of the\ncluster as a whole: it therefore does not seem to be a bound subgroup; c) West\nemission due to a foreground group with self-emission from a Seyfert galaxy\nlocated at the north-west; d) emission in the south-west due to inverse Compton\nemission associated to a very steep radio source (the remnant of an active\ngalactic nucleus). We have examined the possibility for the central peak to be\nan \"unusual\" galaxy, as assumed for the central galaxy of J2310-43 (Tananbaum\net al. 1997). We conclude on the existence of a cooling flow region, in which\nthe presence of at least three small features certainly related to cooler blobs\nis revealed by the wavelet analysis. We have performed a pixel-to-pixel\nmodelling of the double X-ray emission. The large scale emission component is\ncomparable to those derived from by the PSPC data and the small scale one is\ninterpreted as a cooling-flow. A multiphase gas model analysis leads to a mass\ndeposit of 50-150 M_\\odot/yr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 1997 09:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The aim of this article is to introduce some basic notions of\nTopological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) and to consider a modification of TQFT,\napplicable to embedded manifolds. After an introduction based around a simple\nexample (Section 1) the notion of a d-dimensional TQFT is defined in\ncategory-theoretical terms, as a certain type of functor from a category of\nd-dimensional cobordisms to the category of vector spaces (Section 2). A\nconstruction due to Turaev, an operator-valued invariant of tangles, is\ndiscussed in Section 3. It bears a strong resemblance to 1-dimensional TQFTs,\nbut carries much richer structure due to the fact that the 1-dimensional\nmanifolds involved are embedded in a 3-dimensional space. This leads us, in\nSection 4, to propose a class of TQFT-like theories, appropriate to embedded,\nrather than pure, manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 1997 18:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Since every EPP is a\nseparable superoperator, bounds on separable superoperators apply as well to\nEPPs; we use this fact to give a new upper bound on the rate of EPPs on\nBell-diagonal states, and thus on the capacity of Bell-diagonal channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 1997 17:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 1998 18:16:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 1998 17:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
