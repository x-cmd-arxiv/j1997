The redshift of the absorption\nsystem is z = 0.163770 and the neutral hydrogen column density of the\nabsorption system is log N = 19.81 cm**-2. The absorption system is by far the\nlowest redshift confirmed damped Lyman-alpha absorption system yet identified,\nwhich provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine the nature, impact\ngeometry, and kinematics of the absorbing galaxy in great detail. The\nobservations indicate that the absorption system is remarkable in three\nrespects: First, the absorption system is characterized by weak metal\nabsorption lines and a low metal abundance, possibly less than 4% of the solar\nmetal abundance. This cannot be explained as a consequence of dust, because the\nneutral hydrogen column density of the absorption system is far too low for\nobscuration by dust to introduce any significant selection effects. Second, the\nabsorption system is associated with a moderate-luminosity early-type S0\ngalaxy, although the absorption may actually arise in one of several very faint\ngalaxies detected very close to the QSO line of sight.

We derive an exact formal expression for the response operator, which\nis the classical analog of a well-known result in quantum statistical physics.\nWhen the self-gravity of the response can be ignored, and the ensemble-averaged\ngravitational potential is integrable, the expressions for the mode energy,\ndamping rate, and polarization operator reduce to well-known formulae derived\nfrom perturbation theory in action-angle variables.

Comparison with\nobservational data allows us to constrain the black hole parameters, and, for\nthe first time, infer an emissivity profile for the accretion disk. The\ntopological constraints imposed by gauge-theory gravity are exploited to\ninvestigate the nature of the Kerr singularity. This reveals a simple physical\npicture of a ring of matter moving at the speed of light which surrounds a\nsheet of pure isotropic tension. Implications for the end-points of collapse\nprocesses are discussed. Finally we consider rigidly-rotating cosmic strings.\nIt is shown that a solution in the literature has an unphysical stress-energy\ntensor on the axis. Well defined solutions are presented for an ideal\ntwo-dimensional fluid. The exterior vacuum solution admits closed timelike\ncurves and exerts a confining force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 1997 11:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The covariant gauge fixing term and the\nFaddeev-Popov determinant are introduced by hand as a weight for the gauge\naverage. At $\\beta=\\infty$, as noticed by Hata some time ago, the model is\nrenormalizable at one-loop and the gauge fixing term turns into an\nasymptotically free self-coupling of the gauge freedom, even in the presence of\nthe gauge symmetry breaking of the complex phase of chiral determinant. The\nsevere infrared divergence occurs in the perturbation expansion and it prevents\nlocal order parameters from emerging. The Foerster-Nielsen-Ninomiya mechanism\nworks in this perturbative framework: the small explicit gauge symmetry\nbreaking term does not affect the above infrared structure. Based on these\ndynamical features, which is quite similar to the two-dimensional nonlinear\nsigma model, we assume that the global gauge symmetry does not break\nspontaneously and the gauge freedom acquires mass dynamically. The asymptotic\nfreedom allows us to tame the gauge fluctuation by approaching the critical\npoint of the gauge freedom without spoiling its disordered nature. Then it is\nargued that the disordered gauge freedom does not necessarily cause the\nmassless chiral state in the (waveguide) boundary correlation function and that\nthe entire fermion spectrum can be chiral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 1997 16:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Throughout we work\nin the context of the Wilsonian Renormalization Group; namely, as the cutoff of\nthe theory is changed from M to M', we determine the appropriate changes in the\nbare couplings needed to keep the low energy physics fixed. The entire analysis\nis therefore free of infrared subtleties. When the bare Lagrangian given at the\ncutoff is manifestly holomorphic in the gauge coupling, we show that the\nrequired change in the holomorphic gauge coupling is exhausted at 1-loop to all\norders of perturbation theory, and even non-perturbatively in some cases. On\nthe other hand, when the bare Lagrangian has canonically normalized kinetic\nterms, we find that the required change in the gauge coupling is given by the\nNSVZ beta function. The higher order contributions in the NSVZ beta function\nare due to anomalous Jacobians under the rescaling of the fields done in\npassing from holomorphic to canonical normalization. We also give prescriptions\nfor regularizing certain N=1 theories with an ultraviolet cutoff M preserving\nmanifest holomorphy, starting from finite N=4 and N=2 theories.
