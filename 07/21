We show that such a star first undergoes a phase of quasi-static\nexpansion, caused by slow nuclear $\\beta$-decays, lasting for about 20 seconds,\nbut then explodes violently. The kinetic energy of the explosion is around\n$10^{49} erg$, the peak luminosity in electron anti-neutrinos is of order\n$10^{52} erg/s$, and the thermodynamic conditions of the expanding matter are\nfavorable for r-process nucleosynthesis. These results are obtained for the\nHarrison-Wheeler equation of state and a simple and, possibly, unrealistic\ntreatment of $\\beta$-decay rates and nuclear fission, which were adopted for\ncomparison with previous works. However, we do not expect that the outcome will\nchange qualitatively if more recent nuclear input physics used. Although our\nstudy does not rely on a specific scenario ofhow a neutron star starting from a\nbigger (and stable) masscan reach the dynamical phase, we assume that the final\nmass-loss event happens on a very short time scale, i.e., on a time scale\nshorter than a sound-crossing time, by removing a certain amount of mass as an\ninitial perturbation. This assumption implies that the star has no time to\nadjust its nuclear composition to the new mass mass through a sequence of\nquasi-equilibria. In the latter case, however, there exists no stable\nconfiguration below the minimum mass, because the equation of state of fully\ncatalyzed matter is too soft. Therefore, the dynamics of the explosion will not\nbe too different from what have obtained if different initial perturbations are\nassumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 1997 14:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Our\nclusters thus provide a well-defined sample of the most massive systems at\nthese redshifts to quantify the extent and variability of these evolutionary\neffects. Moreover, by concentrating on a narrow redshift range, we can take\nadvantage of the homogeneity of our sample to combine the catalogues from all\nthe clusters to analyse the bulk properties of their populations. The core\nregions of these clusters ontain only a small proportion of star-forming\ngalaxies, and they therefore do not exhibit a `Butcher-Oemler' effect. Focusing\non the redder cluster galaxies we find that their integrated luminosity is well\ncorrelated with the cluster X-ray temperatures, and hence with cluster mass.\nFurthermore, the typical UV-optical colours of the elliptical sequences in the\nclusters exhibit a small cluster-to-cluster scatter, <=2%, indicating that\nthese galaxies are highly homogeneous between clusters.
