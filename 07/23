By a fibrewise equivalence transformation we\nconstruct a homogeneous Fedosov star product of standard ordered type\nequivalent to the homogeneous Fedosov star product of Weyl type.\nRepresentations for both star product algebras by differential operators on\nfunctions on $Q$ are constructed leading in the case of the standard ordered\nproduct to the usual standard ordering prescription for smooth complex-valued\nfunctions on $T^*Q$ polynomial in the momenta (where an arbitrary fixed\ntorsion-free connection $\\nabla_0$ on $Q$ is used). Motivated by the flat case\n$T^* R^n$ another homogeneous star product of Weyl type corresponding to the\nWeyl ordering prescription is constructed. The example of the cotangent bundle\nof an arbitrary Lie group is explicitly computed and the star product given by\nGutt is rederived in our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 1997 15:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

For this purpose, the photon emission process is described on time\nscales much shorter than the lifetime of the excited state using a model based\non Wigner-Weisskopf theory. The backaction of this emission process is\nanalytically described as a quantum diffusion of the Bloch vector. It is shown\nthat the evolution of the atomic wavefunction can be controlled completely\nusing the results of homodyne detection. This allows the stabilization of a\nknown quantum state or the creation of coherent states by a feedback mechanism.\nHowever, the feedback mechanism can never compensate the dissipative effects of\nquantum fluctuations even though the coherent state of the system is known at\nall times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 1997 14:06:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 1998 11:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
