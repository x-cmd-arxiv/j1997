The average emissivity curve (ACEbright) of the\ngroup of bright BATSE bursts is approximated by a simple analytical function,\nwhich takes into account the effect of squeezing of the time pulses with\nincreasing energy of photons.

In general, these states would mix strongly with the conventional\nq-bar-q mesons. However, they can also have exotic quantum numbers inaccessible\nto q-bar-q mesons. Confirmation of such states would give information on the\nrole of \"dynamical\" color in low energy QCD. In the quenched approximation we\npresent a lattice calculation of the masses of mesons with exotic quantum\nnumbers. These hybrid mesons can mix with four quark (q-bar-q-bar-q-q) states.\nThe quenched approximation partially suppresses this mixing. Nonetheless, our\nhybrid interpolating fields also couple to four quark states. Using a four\nquark source operator, we demonstrate this mixing for the 1-+ meson. Using the\nconventional Wilson quark action, we calculate both at reasonably light quark\nmasses, intending to extrapolate to small quark mass, and near the charmed\nquark mass, where we calculate the masses of some c-bar-c-g hybrid mesons. The\nhybrid meson masses are large --- over 4 GeV for charmonium and more than twice\nthe vector meson mass at our smallest quark mass, which is near the strange\nquark mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 1997 10:45:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 1997 01:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
