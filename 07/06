The shell coincides with the maximum in intensity and linewidths of\n[O III] lines in a blueshifted emission nebula which was previously detected\nvia optical spectroscopy by Boer et al. (1992). Such a remarkable outflow\nmorphology has not been observed to date in any other starburst galaxy of\ncomparable luminosity. The radio continuum map reveals a second bubble of\nsimilar size on the opposite side of the nucleus, forming a striking\ndouble-bubble outflow morphology. We argue from the morphology and short\ntimescale ($\\sim$ $4 \\times 10^6$ years) of the outflow that it is dynamically\nyounger than freely-expanding outflows seen in other galaxies which harbor\ncircumnuclear starbursts of comparable luminosity, e.g., M82. We suggest that\nthe outflow in NGC 2782 is in the early stage where thermal instabilities have\nnot yet completely ruptured the outflow bubble.We present evidence that the\noutflow is driving warm and hot ionised gas, and possibly cold molecular gas,\nout of the central kpc of the galaxy. We estimate the contribution of the hot,\nwarm, and cold phases of the ISM to the energetics of the outflow.
