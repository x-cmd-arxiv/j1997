Our starting\npoint is the usual expression for the one-loop correction to the mass of a\nsoliton in terms of sums over zero-point energies. To regulate these sums, most\nauthors put the system in a box with suitable boundary conditions, and impose\nan ultraviolet cut-off. We distinguish between an energy cut-off and a mode\nnumber cut-off, and show that they lead to different results. We claim that\nonly the mode cut-off yields correct results, and only if one considers exactly\nthe same number of bosonic and fermionic modes in the total sum over\nbound-state and zero-point energies. To substantiate this claim, we show that\nin the sine-Gordon model only the mode cut-off yields a result for the quantum\nsoliton mass that is consistent with the exact result for the spectrum as\nobtained by Dashen et al. from quantising the so-called breather solution. In\nthe supersymmetric case, our conclusion is that contrary to previous claims the\nquantum Bogomolnyi bound is not saturated in any of the two-dimensional models\nconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 1997 12:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
