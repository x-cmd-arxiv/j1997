By numerical minimization of the exact London theory energy expression,\nusing simulated annealing techniques, the equilibrium configurations are\ndetermined with great accuracy over a wide range of fields and currents. These\nconsist of chains of straight vortex-lines whose number depends both on the\nfield and on the current.
