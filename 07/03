The NIR is\ncoherently linked to the visible and the ultraviolet, so that the model is\ncontinuous on an exceptionally large wavelength range from 220 A up to 5\nmicrons. Moreover, a precise algorithm allows to follow very rapid evolutionary\nphases such as red supergiants or AGB crucial in the NIR. The nebular component\nis also computed in the NIR. The extinction correction is gas-dependent for\nspirals and ellipticals. A set of reference synthetic spectra at z=0, to which\napply cosmological k- and evolution e- corrections for high-redshift galaxies,\nis built from fits of observational templates. Because of the lack of visible\nto NIR spectral templates for each Hubble type, we adopt statistical samples of\ncolors, not fitted by previous models.

Starting\nfrom a reconstruction of the cluster mass distribution with conventional\ntechniques, we apply a maximum likelihood method to infer the average\nproperties of an ensemble of cluster galaxies.

Utilizing the\nrepresentation $\\Psi(\\xi) = \\sum_{i}a_i[E]\\xi^i R_{\\beta}(\\xi)$, for an\nappropriate reference function, $R_{\\beta}(\\xi)$, we demonstrate that the\n(convergent) zeroes of the coefficient functions, $a_i[E] = 0$, approximate the\nexact bound/resonance state energies with increasing accuracy as $i \\to\n\\infty$. The validity of the approach is shown to be based on an extension of\nthe Hill determinant quantization procedure. Our method has been applied, with\nremarkable success, to various quantum mechanical problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 1997 18:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
