Unlike most analyses, which have attributed chaos to\nnegative curvature, this work exploits the fact that geodesics can be chaotic\neven if K is everywhere positive, chaos arising as a parameteric instability\ntriggered by regular variations in K along the orbit. For ensembles of fixed\nenergy, with both regular and chaotic segments, simple patterns connect the\nvalues of <K> and k for different segments, both with each other and with the\nshort time Lyapunov exponent X.

It is shown that\nthe microcanonical T(E) contains important information about the transition\nwhich becomes suppressed in the canonical ensemble. The implications for our\nunderstanding of phase transitions in general are discussed. For these finite\nmetallic systems it is essential to allow for a fragmentation of the system.\nOur result demonstrates further that microcanonical Metropolis Monte Carlo\nsampling (MMMC) is well suited to establish the link between the fragmentation\nphase transition in small systems like nuclei and atomic clusters and the\nliquid-gas transition of infinite matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 1997 10:29:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 1997 08:19:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Factorizing the collinear\nsingularity associated with initial state photon bremsstrahlung into the parton\ndistribution functions, we find that initial state corrections have a much\nsmaller effect than final state radiative corrections. Due to mass singular\nlogarithmic terms associated with photons emitted collinear with one of the\nfinal state leptons, QED radiative corrections strongly affect the shape of the\ndi-lepton invariant mass distribution, the lepton transverse momentum spectrum,\nand the forward backward asymmetry, $A_{FB}$. They lead to a sizeable shift in\nthe $Z$ boson mass extracted from data, decrease the di-lepton cross section by\nup to 10\\%, and increase the integrated forward backward asymmetry in the $Z$\npeak region by about 7\\% at the Tevatron. We also investigate how experimental\nlepton identification requirements modify the effect of the QED corrections,\nand study the prospects for a high precision measurement of\n$\\sin^2\\theta^{lept}_{eff}$ using the forward backward asymmetry at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 1997 23:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The loss reflects the transmission\nquality: if the loss is zero, quantum information can be perfectly transmitted\nat a rate measured by the quantum source entropy. By using block coding based\non sequences of n entangled symbols, the average loss (defined as the overall\nloss of the joint n-symbol channel divided by n, when n tends to infinity) can\nbe made lower than the loss for a single use of the channel. In this context,\nwe examine several upper bounds on the rate at which quantum information can be\ntransmitted reliably via a noisy channel, that is, with an asymptotically\nvanishing average loss while the one-symbol loss of the channel is non-zero.\nThese bounds on the channel capacity rely on the entropic Singleton bound on\nquantum error-correcting codes [Phys. Rev. A 56, 1721 (1997)]. Finally, we\nanalyze the Singleton bounds when the noisy quantum channel is supplemented\nwith a classical auxiliary channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 1997 03:44:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 1998 02:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

The uncertainty\nrelations are an expression of this, fundamental, arbitrariness. Electrons and\nphotons can be described by an identical formalism, providing formulations\nequivalent to the Maxwell equations.
