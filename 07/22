On the background of an algebraically refined Chomsky hierarchy, which\nallows the definition of several classes of languages--in particular, a whole\nhierarchy between CF and CS--via regular tree grammars over unambiguously\nderivable alphabets of varying complexity plus their respective\nyield-functions, it shows that not only some non-context-free string languages\ncan be captured by context-free means in this way, but that this approach can\nbe generalized to the corresponding structures. I.e., non-recognizable sets of\nstructures can--up to homomorphism--be coded context-freely. Since the class of\nlanguages covered--Fischer's (1968} OI family of indexed languages--includes\nall attested instances of non-context-freeness in natural language, there\nexists an indirect, to be sure, but completely general way to formally describe\nthe natural languages using a weak framework like MSO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 1997 11:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Our analysis expands\non the well known connection between solutions of the sine-Gordon equation and\nconstant curvature metrics. In particular, we show that solutions to the\ndilaton field equations for a given metric in JT theory also solve the\nsine-Gordon equation linearized about the corresponding soliton. Since the\ndilaton generates Killing vectors of the constant curvature metric, it is\ninteresting that it has an analoguous interpretation in terms of symmetries of\nthe soliton solution. We also show that from the B${\\ddot a}$cklund\ntransformations relating different soliton solutions, it is possible to\nconstruct a flat SL(2,R) connection which forms the basis for the gauge theory\nformulation of JT dilaton gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 1997 16:31:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 1997 17:56:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 1997 12:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
