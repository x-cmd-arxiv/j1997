The fading of\ninactive sources, and the effect of the intermittency on the expansion\nvelocity, can readily explain the observed over-abundance of small radio\nsources. In particular, the plateau in the observed distribution of sizes found\nby O'Dea & Baum (1997) can be interpreted as being due to intermittency. The\nmodel predicts that very young sources will be particularly radio luminous,\nonce the effects of absorption have been accounted for. Furthermore, it\npredicts the existence of a significant number of faint `coasting' sources.\nThese might be detectable in deep, low-frequency radio maps, or via the X-ray\nand optical emission line properties of the shock front.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jul 1997 18:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
