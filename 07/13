The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) imaging\nsurvey has achieved the sensitivity to capture the bulk of the extragalactic\nbackground light from discrete sources. No evidence is found in the optical\nnumber-magnitude relation down to AB=29 mag for a large amount of star\nformation at high redshifts. The emission history of the universe at\nultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared wavelengths can be modeled from the\npresent epoch to z~4 by tracing the evolution with cosmic time of the galaxy\nluminosity density, as determined from several deep spectroscopic samples and\nthe HDF. The global spectrophotometric properties of field galaxies are well\nfitted by a simple stellar evolution model, defined by a time-dependent star\nformation rate (SFR) per unit comoving volume and a universal initial mass\nfunction which is relatively rich in massive stars. The SFR density is found to\nrise sharply, by about an order of magnitude, from a redshift of zero to a peak\nvalue at z~1.5, to fall again by a factor of 2 (4) out of a redshift of 3 (4).\nSince only 10% of the current stellar content of galaxies is produced at z>2.5,\na rather low cosmic metallicity is predicted at these early times, in good\nagreement with the observed enrichment history of the damped Lyman-\\alpha\nsystems. The biggest uncertainty is represented by the poorly constrained\namount of starlight that was absorbed by dust and reradiated in the IR at early\nepochs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jul 1997 18:03:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

An entire quadrant of the\ncluster has been covered, out to ~2.0 times the tidal radius. A CMD down to\nabout 4 magnitudes below the turn-off is presented and analysed. A large\npopulation of BS has been identified. The BS are significantly more\nconcentrated in the inner 300 arcsec, while they become less concentrated in\nthe cluster envelope. We have obtained luminosity functions at various radial\nintervals from the center and their corresponding mass functions. Both clearly\nshow the presence of mass segregation inside the cluster. A dynamical analysis\nshows that the observed mass segregation is compatible with what is predicted\nby multi-mass King-Michie models. The global mass function is very flat with a\npower-law slope of x=-1.0+/-0.4. This suggest that M55 might have suffered\nselective losses of stars, caused by tidal interactions with the Galactic disk\nand bulge. The radial density profile of M55 out to ~2.0 r_t suggests the\npresence of extra-tidal stars whose nature could be connected with the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jul 1997 18:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
