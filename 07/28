The results obtained\nindicate that, within the existing uncertainties in the eta-Nucleon input data,\na bound state could exist. By a qualitative consideration it is shown that such\nbound-states, cannot be narrow.

Our discussion includes both, a\nmodel- independent analysis of these parameters in the Gaussian approximation,\nand the study of a class of hydrodynamical models which mimic essential\ngeometrical and dynamical properties of peripheral heavy ion collisions. Also,\nwe discuss the additional geometrical and dynamical information contained in\nthe harmonic coefficients of these HBT radius parameters. The leading\ncontribution of their first and second harmonics are found to satisfy simple\nconstraints. This allows for a minimal, azimuthally sensitive parametrization\nof all first and second harmonic coefficients in terms of only two additional\nfit parameters. We determine to what extent these parameters can be extracted\nfrom experimental data despite finite multiplicity fluctuations and the\nresulting uncertainty in the reconstruction of the reaction plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 1997 14:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
