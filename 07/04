The small aperture (~65 mm) permits\ndetection of stellar flux variations corresponding to magnitudes 7<I<16,\nwhereas current searches are restricted by saturation to I>15. The large pixel\nsize (~10\") and ~(6 deg)^2 field of view allows observation of the entire bulge\nwith a few pointings. With this large pixel size (and with the even larger 30\"\nPSF that we advocate) most bulge stars are unresolved, so one is in the regime\nof pixel lensing: microlensing and other forms of stellar variation are\ndetected from the difference of pixel counts in successive images.

First, the observations are analogous to\nnormal pixel lensing observations of the bulge of M31, but are carried out\nunder conditions where the detected events can be followed up in detail. This\npermits crucial checks on the systematics of the M31 searches. Second, the\nsearch gives a complete inventory of bright bulge variables.

Considering\ne.g. the annular billiard we decompose tunneling-related energy splittings and\nshifts into sums over paths in phase space. We show that tunneling transport is\ndominated by chaos-assisted paths that tunnel into and out of the chaotic layer\nvia the ``beach'' regions sandwiched between the regular islands and the\nchaotic sea. Level splittings are shown to fluctuate on two scales as functions\nof energy or an external parameter: they display a dense sequence of peaks due\nto resonances with states supported by the chaotic sea, overlaid on top of slow\nmodulations arising from resonances with states supported by the ``beaches''.\nWe obtain analytic expressions which enable us to assess the relative\nimportance of tunneling amplitudes into the chaotic sea vs. its internal\ntransport properties. Finally, we average over the statistics of the chaotic\nregion, and derive the asymptotic tail of the splitting distribution function\nunder rather general assumptions concerning the fluctuation properties of\nchaotic states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 1997 16:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
