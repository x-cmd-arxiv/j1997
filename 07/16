M. Keck Telescope of\nthe z=3.8 radio galaxy 4C41.17 show that the UV continuum emission from this\ngalaxy, which is aligned with the radio axis, is unpolarized (P[2sigma] <\n2.4%). This implies that scattered AGN light, which is generally the dominant\ncontributor to the rest-frame UV emission in z~1 radio galaxies, is unlikely to\nbe a major component of the UV flux from 4C41.17. The spectrum shows absorption\nlines that are similar to those detected in the spectra of the recently\ndiscovered population of star forming galaxies at z~2-3. A galaxian outflow may\ncontribute partially to the low ionization absorption lines; however, the high\nvelocity wings of the high ionization lines are unlikely to be dominated by a\ngalaxian wind since the implied outflow mass is very large. The detection of\nstellar absorption lines, the shape of the SiIV profile, the unpolarized\ncontinuum, the inability of any AGN-related processes to account for the UV\nflux, and the similarity of the UV continuum spectra of 4C41.17 and the nearby\nstarburst region NGC 1741B1 suggest that the UV light in 4C41.17 is dominated\nby young stars. If so, the implied star-formation rate is roughly\n140-1100Msun/yr. We discuss the possibility that star formation in 4C41.17 was\ntriggered by the radio source. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that\n4C41.17 is undergoing its major epoch of star formation at z~4, and that by z~1\nit will have evolved to have spectral and morphological properties similar to\nthose observed in known z~1 powerful radio galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 1997 21:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
