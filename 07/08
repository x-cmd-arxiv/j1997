With these assumptions the\npredicted population can match both present-day disks and the damped Lyman\nalpha absorbers in QSO spectra. Good agreement is found provided: (i) the\nmasses of disks are a few percent of those of their haloes; (ii) the specific\nangular momenta of disks are similar to those of their haloes; (iii)\npresent-day disks were assembled recently (at z<1).

For an\narbitrarily-shaped finite dielectric, the first finite-volume correction to the\ndensity of states is shown to be proportional to the surface area of the\ndielectric interface and is explicitly evaluated as a function of the\npermeability and permitivity. Since these calculations are founded in an\nelementary and straightforward way on the underlying physics of the Casimir\neffect they serve as an important consistency check on field-theoretic\ncalculations.
