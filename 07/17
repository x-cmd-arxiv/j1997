As a consequence\n$\\zeta_n$ are determined by solvability conditions and not from power counting.\nIt is arguedthat in order to achieve such a formulation one must recognize that\nthe many-point space-time correlators are not scale invariant in time\narguments.

To this aim we show that\nthe fully resummed perturbation theory is equivalent in its contents to the\nexact hierarchy of equations obeyed by the $n$th order correlators and Green's\nfunction. In light of this important result we can safely use finite\nresummations to construct successive closures. This paper presents the\nconceptual and technical details of the scheme.

Among new results we present a theoretical\nconstruct in which a fermion and an antifermion have the same intrinsic parity;\ndiscuss phase transformations and find relations between the Majorana-like\nfield operator $\\nu$, given by Ahluwalia, and the Dirac field operator. Also we\ngive explicit forms of the $j=1$ ``spinors\" in the Majorana representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 1997 23:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}
