Since the\noptical-phonons in III-V materials have a considerably larger coupling to\nelectrons than acoustic phonons (which are the dominant drag mechanism at low T\nand large separations) it might be expected that the optical phonons will give\na large effect high temperatures. The two key differences between optical and\nacoustic phonon mediated drag are: (1) the optical phonon mediated interlayer\ninteraction is short-ranged due to their negligible group velocity at the\nBrillouin zone center; and (2) the typical momentum transfer for an optical\nphonon mediated scattering is relatively large. These considerations make\noptical phonon mediated drag difficult to see in single subband GaAs systems,\nbut it may be possible to see the effect in double subband GaAs systems or\nsingle subband quantum wells in a material with a lower effective mass and\nlower optical phonon energy such as InSb.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 1997 20:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The pulses\nconsidered are essentially arbitrary, but we distinguish between three\nsituations. First the total classical momentum transfer is non-vanishing,\nsecond not both the total classical momentum transfer and the total classical\ndisplacement are vanishing together with the requirement that the potential has\na finite number of bound states and third both the total classical momentum\ntransfer and the total classical displacement are vanishing. For the first two\ncases we rigorously prove, that the ionization probability tends to one when\nthe amplitude of the pulse tends to infinity and the pulse shape remains fixed.\nIn the third case the limit is strictly smaller than one. This case is also\nrelated to the high frequency limit considered by Gavrila et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 1997 15:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
