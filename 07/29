This timescale is more than\ntwo orders of magnitude smaller than what is expected from the standard theory\nof tidal dissipation. Kumar and Quataert (1997a) proposed that this rapid\nevolution can be understood provided that the neutron star's companion, a main\nsequence B-star, has set up significant differential rotation. They showed that\nthe spin synchronization time for the B-star is similar to the orbit\ncircularization time, whereas the time to synchronize the surface rotation is\nmuch shorter, and thus significant differential rotation in the star is indeed\nexpected. However, their calculation did not include the various processes that\ncan redistribute angular momentum in the star, possibly forcing it into solid\nbody rotation; in that case the dissipation of the tide would not be enhanced.\nThe goal of this paper is to include the redistribution of angular momentum in\nthe B-star due to meridional circulation and shear stresses and to calculate\nthe resulting rotation profile as a function of time. We find that although\nangular momentum redistribution is important, the B-star continues to have\nsufficient differential rotation so that tidal waves are entirely absorbed as\nthey arrive at the surface. The mechanism proposed by Kumar and Quataert to\nspeed up the orbital evolution of the SMC binary pulsar should therefore work\nas suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 1997 17:55:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 1997 14:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Experimentally, thanks to technological developments, we are on\nthe verge of invading the territory of extreme N/Z ratios in an unprecedented\nway. Theoretically, nuclear exotica represent a formidable challenge for the\nnuclear many-body theories and their power to predict nuclear properties in\nnuclear terra incognita. It is important to remember that the lesson learned by\ngoing to the limits of the nuclear binding is also important for normal nuclei\nfrom the neighborhood of the beta stability valley. And, of course, radioactive\nnuclei are crucial astrophysically; they pave the highway along which the\nnuclear material is transported up in the proton and neutron numbers during the\ncomplicated synthesis process in stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 1997 21:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Various criteria for\napproximate consistency are analysed. The connection between the\nDowker-Halliwell criterion and sphere packing problems is shown and used to\nprove several new bounds on the violation of probability sum rules. The quantum\nZeno effect is also analysed within the consistent histories formalism and used\nto demonstrate some of the difficulties involved in discussing approximate\nconsistency. The complications associated with null histories and infinite sets\nare briefly discussed.\n  The possibility of using the properties of the Schmidt decomposition to\ndefine an algorithm which selects a single, physically natural, consistent set\nfor pure initial density matrices is investigated. The problems that arise are\nexplained, and different possible algorithms discussed. Their properties are\nanalysed with the aid of simple models. A set of computer programs is described\nwhich apply the algorithms to more complicated examples.\n  Another algorithm is proposed that selects the consistent set (formed using\nSchmidt projections) with the highest Shannon information. This is applied to a\nsimple model and shown to produce physically sensible histories. The theory is\ncapable of unconditional probabilistic prediction for closed quantum systems,\nand is strong enough to be falsifiable. Ideas on applying the theory to more\ncomplicated examples are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 1997 07:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
