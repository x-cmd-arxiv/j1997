We proceed under the assumption that damped Lyman alpha\nsystems represent a population of cold, rotationally supported, protogalactic\ndisks and that the abundance of protogalactic halos is well approximated by a\ncold dark matter model with critical density and vanishing cosmological\nconstant. Using conditional cross sections to observe a damped system with a\ngiven velocity width and column density, we compare observationally inferred\nvelocity width and column density distributions to the corresponding\ntheoretically determined distributions for a variety of disk parameters and CDM\nnormalizations. In general, we find that the observations can not be reproduced\nby the models for most disk parameters and CDM normalizations. Whereas the\ncolumn density distribution favors small disks with large neutral gas fraction,\nthe velocity width distribution favors large and thick disks with small neutral\ngas fraction. The possible resolutions of this problem in the context of this\nCDM model may be: (1) an increased contribution of rapidly rotating disks\nwithin massive dark matter halos to damped Lyman-alpha absorption or (2) the\nabandoning of simple disk models within this CDM model for damped Lyman-alpha\nsystems at high redshift. Here the first possibility may be achieved by\nsupposing that damped Lya system formation only occurs in halos with fairly\nlarge circular velocities and the second possibility may result from a large\ncontribution of mergers and double-disks to damped Lya absorption at high\nredshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 1997 17:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Phase transitions\nconsidered include, the ferromagnetic transition, the antiferromagnetic\ntransition, the superconductor-metal transition, and various metal-insulator\ntransitions. Emphasis is placed on how to determine the universal properties\nthat characterize these quantum phase transitions. For the first three of the\nphase transitions listed above, one of the main physical ideas established is\nthat in zero-temperature systems there are soft or slow modes that exist in\naddition to the soft order parameter fluctuations, and that these modes can\ncouple to the critical modes. These extra soft modes are shown to have a\nprofound effect on the quantum critical properties. For quantum phase\ntransitions involving zero wavenumber order parameters, i.e., the ferromagnetic\nand superconductor-metal transitions, these extra modes effectively lead to\nlong-ranged effective interactions between order parameter fluctuations, which\nin turn lead to exactly soluble critical behaviors. For the antiferromagnetic\ncase, we argue that while in low enough dimensions disorder fluctuation effects\ntend to destroy long-range order, quantum fluctuations counteract this effect\nand in some parameter regions manage to re-establish antiferromagnetic\nlong-range order. For the metal-insulator transition, some recent new ideas are\nreviewed. In particular, it is pointed out that for interacting disordered\nelectrons, one expects that in high dimensions the metal-insulator transition\nis related to the phase transition that occurs in random-field magnets in high\ndimensions.

The reversal of quantum operations is important for\nquantum error-correcting codes, teleportation, and reversing quantum\nmeasurements. We derive information-theoretic conditions and equivalent\nalgebraic conditions that are necessary and sufficient for a general quantum\noperation to be reversible. We analyze the thermodynamic cost of error\ncorrection and show that error correction can be regarded as a kind of\n``Maxwell demon,'' for which there is an entropy cost associated with\ninformation obtained from measurements performed during error correction. A\nprescription for thermodynamically efficient error correction is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 1997 20:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
