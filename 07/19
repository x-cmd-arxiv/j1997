This powerful (2E46 erg/s)\nquasar was studied in detail with ROSAT, and the combination of the X-ray data\nand optical/near-infrared spectropolarimetry strongly suggested the presence of\na dusty ionized (`warm') absorber along the line of sight to the central X-ray\nsource. The ASCA spectra, in contrast to an earlier claim, show evidence for\nionized oxygen edges, and the presence of such edges appears to provide the\nmost physically plausible interpretation of the data. Thus, the ASCA spectra\nsupport the dusty warm absorber hypothesis. The ASCA data also allow the\nphysical properties of the warm absorber to be constrained far better than\nbefore. A one-zone warm absorber model indicates the ionized column to be in\nthe range (2--6) x 10^{21} cm^{-2}, and it gives an ionization parameter of\nxi=31^{+12}_{-12} erg cm s^{-1}. The dusty warm absorber appears to have a\ndensity below 3E8 cm^{-3}, and it is probably located outside the broad-line\nregion. The dust in the warm absorber does not appear to have been heavily\nsputtered or destroyed via other means. Based on the ASCA fitting, we suggest\nthat ultraviolet absorption lines from the warm absorber may be detectable and\ndiscuss how they can further constrain the warm absorber properties. We compare\nand contrast the X-ray properties of IRAS 13349+2438 with those of broad\nabsorption line quasars. We comment on the steep > 2 keV continuum of IRAS\n13349+2438 and examine the relevance to some models of radiative Fe II\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 1997 21:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The\nscheme requires that temporal and tangential components of perturbations of the\npotential should vanish at the boundary, jointly with the gauge-averaging\nfunctional, first chosen of the Lorenz type. Gauge invariance of such boundary\nconditions is then obtained provided that the ghost fields vanish at the\nboundary. Normal and longitudinal modes of the potential obey an entangled\nsystem of eigenvalue equations, whose solution is a linear combination of\nBessel functions under the above assumptions, and with the help of the Feynman\nchoice for a dimensionless gauge parameter. Interestingly, ghost modes cancel\nexactly the contribution to the Casimir energy resulting from transverse and\ntemporal modes of the potential, jointly with the decoupled normal mode of the\npotential. Moreover, normal and longitudinal components of the potential for\nthe interior and the exterior problem give a result in complete agreement with\nthe one first found by Boyer, who studied instead boundary conditions involving\nTE and TM modes of the electromagnetic field. The coupled eigenvalue equations\nfor perturbative modes of the potential are also analyzed in the axial gauge,\nand for arbitrary values of the gauge parameter. The set of modes which\ncontribute to the Casimir energy is then drastically changed, and comparison\nwith the case of a flat boundary sheds some light on the key features of the\nCasimir energy in non-covariant gauges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 1997 17:27:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 1997 07:14:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 1998 19:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
