We\ndiscuss a simple model for slow rollover inflation which is minimal in the\nsense that the inflaton may be identified with the field responsible for the\ngeneration of the $\\mu$-term. Inflation takes place at very late times and is\ncharacterized by a very low reheating temperature. This property is crucial to\nsolve the gravitino problem and may help to ameliorate the cosmological moduli\nproblem. The COBE normalized value of the vacuum energy driving inflation is\nnaturally of the order of $10^{11}$ GeV. This favors the N=1 supergravity\nscenario where supersymmetry breaking is mediated by gravitational\ninteractions. Nonetheless, smaller values of the vacuum energy are not excluded\nby present data on the temperature anisotropy and the inflationary scenario may\nbe implemented in the context of new recent ideas about gauge mediation where\nthe standard model gauge interactions can serve as the messangers of\nsupersymmetry breaking. In this class of models supersymmetry breaking masses\nare usually prop ortional to the F-term of a gauge singlet superfield.

In\nthis paper we present combinatorial formulas for the action of Steenrod\noperations on the cohomology of Grassmannians, both in the Borel and the\nSchubert picture. We consider integral lifts of Steenrod operations, which lie\nin a certain Hopf algebra of differential operators. The latter has been\nconsidered recently as a realization of the Landweber-Novikov algebra in\ncomplex cobordism theory; it also has connections with the action of the\nVirasoro algebra on the boson Fock space. Our formulas for Steenrod operations\nare based on combinatorial methods which have not been used before in this\narea, namely Hammond operators and the combinatorics of Schur functions. We\nalso discuss several applications of our formulas to the geometry of\nGrassmannians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jul 1997 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
