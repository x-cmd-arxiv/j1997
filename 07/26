For \"maximal disks\", a\nlarge fraction (0.85 +/- 0.10) of the total rotational support, V2.2, at such\nradii should arise from their stellar mass.

We\nmodel adiabatic infall of varying amounts of luminous matter into dark matter\nhalos and find that the TF relation residuals require a mean value of\nV2.2/Vtotal ~ 0.6 +/- 0.1, fairly insensitive to the details of the initial\ndark matter halo and to the presence of a bulge.
