However, considering how successfully the spherical corona\nreproduces the 10 - 200 keV data, such ``photon-starved'' coronal geometries\nseem very promising for explaining the accretion processes of Cygnus X-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 1997 19:26:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 1998 01:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

This expansion is made by\nfirst fitting a tilted-ring model to the velocity field of the gas disk and\nsubsequently expanding the velocity field along each ring into its harmonic\nterms. We use epicycle theory to derive equations for the harmonic terms in a\ndistorted potential. The phase of each component of the distortion can vary\nwith radius. We show that if the potential has a distortion of harmonic number\nm, the velocity field as seen on the sky exhibits an m-1 and m+1 distortion.

This coupling is large. We\ninvestigate its consequences for the width of $\\omega$-mesons in matter and for\nthe s-wave annihilation of pions into lepton pairs which can take place in\nrelativistic heavy ion collisions. We find that the two pion decay of\n$\\omega$-mesons, resulting from the $\\omega-\\sigma$ transition and the\nsubsequent $2\\pi$ decay of the $\\sigma$-meson, leads to a substantial\nbroadening of $\\omega$-mesons in matter and possibly to an observable effect in\nexperiments measuring the $e^+e^-$ decay of vector mesons produced in nuclei\nand in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The inverse process, the s-wave\nannihilation of pions into $\\omega$-mesons decaying into $e^+e^-$ pairs, has in\ngeneral a much smaller cross section than the corresponding p-wave annihilation\nthrough $\\rho$-mesons and is expected to contribute rather little to the total\n$e^+e^-$ pair production in relativistic heavy ion collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 1997 14:38:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 1998 10:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The supposition that the observables of a system `possess'\nobjective values is purely idealistic. According to the SI view, the state-\nvector collapse cannot result from the Schroedinger evolution of a system (even\nwith its environment), but only from the empirical production of a mathematical\nsymbol, irreducible to the quantum level. The production of a symbol always\ntakes some time. Thus the state-vector collapse cannot be instantaneous\n(Schneider 1994), a specific prediction of the present model.\n  From this interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, the appearances of the body\nare the result of state-vector collapses of several types, i.e. the production\nof different kinds of symbols. In fact the universe of symbols is very rich: a\nsymbol can have a conceptual `value' (like in physics and then give rise to a\nmeasurement), or other qualitative values (like in many human behaviors). In\nthe latter case, the Semiotic Interpretation of QM gives a way to understand\nhow a mental representation can modify the state of the body.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 1997 09:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
