The majority of bright early-type galaxies in this field are found at\nredshifts $z \\leq 1.3$ to share common properties with those of high-z cluster\nsamples, as for the age and mass of the dominant stellar population -- which\nare found to be as old as 3-5 Gyr and as massive as $10^{11} M_\\odot$ already\nat $z\\simeq 1$. There is no evidence of a steepening of the mass function from\n$z$=0 to $z$=1, as inferred by some authors from analyses of optically-selected\nsamples and favoured by hierarchical clustering models forming most of the\nE/S0s at $z<1$. What distinguishes this sample is a remarkable absence of\nobjects at $z>1.3$, which would be expected as clearly detectable above the\nflux limits, given the aged properties of the lower redshift counterparts. So,\nsomething hide them at high redshifts. Merging could be an explanation, but it\nwould require that already formed and old stellar systems would assemble on\nshort timescales of 1 Gyr or less. Only a negligible fraction of the galactic\nmass in young stars has to be added, a rather contrived situation from the\ndynamical point of view. An alternative interpretation could be that a\ndust-polluted ISM obscures the first 3 to 4 Gyr of the evolution of these\nmassive systems, after which a galactic wind and gas consumption makes them\ntransparent. The presence of dust would have relevant (and testable)\nimplications for the evaluation of the global energetics from galaxy formation\nand for the visibility of the early phases by current and future infrared\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 1997 16:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The dependence of transverse-momentum and rapidity spectra on the\nbeam energy and on the centrality of the collison is presented. It is shown\nthat the scaling of the mean rapidity shift of protons established for AGS and\nSPS energies is valid down to 1 AGeV. The degree of nuclear stopping is\ndiscussed; the IQMD transport model reproduces the measured proton rapidity\nspectra for the most central events reasonably well, but does not show any\nsensitivity between the soft and the hard equation of state (EoS). A radial\nflow analysis, using the midrapidity transverse-momentum spectra, delivers\nfreeze-out temperatures T and radial flow velocities beta_r which increase with\nbeam energy up to 2 AGeV; in comparison to existing data of Au on Au over a\nlarge range of energies only beta_r shows a system size dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 1997 18:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}
