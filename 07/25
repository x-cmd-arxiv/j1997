We examine this\nissue taking into account ambipolar drift, which obtains in a galaxy with\nsignificant neutral gas. We argue that, (1) the small-scale dynamo generated\nfield does not fill the volume, but is concentrated into intermittent rope like\nstructures. The flux ropes are curved on the turbulent eddy scales. Their\nthickness is set by the diffusive scale determined by the effective ambipolar\ndiffusion; (2) For a largely neutral galactic gas, the small-scale dynamo\nsaturates, due to inefficient random stretching, when the peak field in a flux\nrope has grown to a few times the equipartition value; (3) The average energy\ndensity in the saturated small-scale field is sub equipartition, since it does\nnot fill the volume; (4) Such fields neither drain significant energy from the\nturbulence nor convert eddy motion of the turbulence on the outer scale into\nwavelike motion.
