We first infer that irregular galaxies and the disks of\nspiral galaxies are young, probably formed at $z\\approx 0.5-2$ from a\nsimultaneous consideration of colours and gas content under a moderate\nassumption on the star formation history. Assuming that elliptical galaxies and\nbulges of spiral galaxies, both called spheroids in the discussion, had formed\nearly in the universe, the resulting scenario is that spiral galaxies formed as\nintergalactic gas accreting onto pre-existing bulges mostly at $z\\approx 1-2$;\nirregular galaxies as seen today formed by aggregation of clouds at $z\\approx\n0.5-1.5$. Taking the formation epochs thus estimated into account, we construct\na model for the history of galaxies employing a stellar population synthesis\nmodel. We assume that the number of galaxies does not change except that some\nof them (irregulars) were newly born, and use a morphology-dependent local\nluminosity function to constrain the number of galaxies. The predictions of the\nmodel are compared with the observation of galaxy number counts and redshift\ndistributions for the $B$, $I$ and $K$ colour bands. It is shown that young\nirregular galaxies cause the steep slope of the $B$-band counts. The fraction\nof irregular galaxies increases with decreasing brightness: at $B=24$ mag, they\ncontribute as much as spiral galaxies. Thus, ``the faint blue galaxy problem''\nis solved by invoking young galaxies. This interpretation is corroborated by a\ncomparison of our prediction with the morphologically-classified galaxy counts\nin the $I$ band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 1997 08:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

In this paper, we address the question whether\nor not the indices Mg2 and <Fe> (and their gradients) are real indicators of\nchemical abundances and enhancement of these or other effects must be taken\ninto account. We show that this is not the case because the above indices are\nseverely affected by the unknown relative percentage of stars as function of\nthe metallicity. In order to cast the problem, first we provide basic\ncalibrations for the variations dHb, dMg2, and d<Fe> as a function of the age\nDlog(t) (in Gyr), metallicity Dlog(Z/Z_o), and D[Mg/Fe]. Second, we analyze the\nimplications of the gradients in Mg2 and <Fe> observed across these systems.\nFinally, the above calibration is used to explore the variations from galaxy to\ngalaxy of the nuclear values of Hb, Mg2, and <Fe>. The differences dHb, dMg2,\nand d<Fe> are converted to differences Dlog(t), Dlog(Z/Z_o), and D[Mg/Fe]. We\nthoroughly examine the relationship Dlog(t)-Mv, Dlog(Z/Z_o)-Mv, and\nD[Mg/Fe]-Mv, and advance the suggestion that the duration of the star forming\nperiod gets longer or the age of the last episode of stellar activity gets\ncloser to the present at decreasing galaxy mass.

In brief, we conclude that none of these can explain the results\nof our analysis, and suggest that the kind of time and space dependent IMF\nproposed by Padoan et al.

At low fields (H < H^*), the in-phase susceptibility shows a\nsharp drop at $T_c$ followed by a gradual decrease with decreasing temperature,\nwhile the out-of-phase component shows a large peak at T_c followed by an\nunusual broad peak. As the B-C phase line is crossed (H>H^*), however, both the\nin-phase and out-of-phase susceptibilities resemble the zero-field Meissner\ncurves.
