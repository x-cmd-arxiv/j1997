The starburst model was constructed by\ncombining two stellar evolutionary synthesis models with a model describing the\nradiative transfer of stellar photons through dust. The stellar evolutionary\nsynthesis models were used to compute the dust-free SEDs for stellar\npopulations with ages between 1x10^6 and 15x10^9 years. Using a Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer model, the effects of dust were computed for average Milky\nWay (MW) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) dust, two different star/dust\ngeometries, and locally homogeneous or clumpy dust. Using color-color plots,\nthe starburst model was used to interpret the behavior of 30 starbursts with\naperture-matched UV and optical SEDs (and IR for 19 of the 30) from previous\nstudies. From the color-color plots, it was evident that the dust in starbursts\nhas an extinction curve lacking a 2175 A bump, like the SMC curve, and a steep\nfar-UV rise, intermediate between the MW and SMC curves. The star/dust geometry\nwhich is able to explain the distribution of the 30 starbursts in various\ncolor-color plots has an inner dust-free sphere of stars surrounded by an outer\nstar-free shell of clumpy dust. When combined with other work from the\nliterature on the Orion region and the 30 Dor region of the Large Magellanic\nCloud, this work implies a trend in dust properties with star formation\nintensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 1997 19:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Axion field fluctuations about a\nhomogeneous background field can yield a scale-invariant (Harrison-Zel'dovich)\nspectrum.

For E_8 Lie algebra, cancellation of\nanomalies is the principal fact leading to the existence of heterotic string.\nThey are in fact nothing but the 6th order cohomologies of corresponding Lie\nalgebras. Beyond 6th order, the calculations seem to require special care and\nit could be that their study will be worthwhile in the light of developments of\nthe second string revolution.\n  As we have shown in a recent article, for A_N Lie algebras, there is a method\nwhich are based on the calculations of Casimir eigenvalues. This is extended to\nE_8 Lie algebra in the present article. In the generality of any irreducible\nrepresentation of E_8 Lie algebra, we consider 8th and 12th order cohomologies\nwhile emphasizing the diversities between the two. It is seen that one can\nrespectively define 2 and 8 basic invariant polinomials in terms of which 8th\nand 12th order Casimir eigenvalues are always expressed as linear\nsuperpositions. All these can be easily investigated because each one of these\ninvariant polinimials gives us a linear equation to calculate E_8 weight\nmultiplicities. Our results beyond order 12 are not included here because they\nget more complicated though share the same characteristic properties with 12th\norder calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 1997 12:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The\nlocal enzyme concentration then determines the rate at which the unstressed\nshape of a wall element relaxes toward its stressed shape.
