We confirm the dynamical\nreality of all but one of the original sample, and find velocity dispersions\ncomparable with present-day clusters of equivalent comoving space density.\nThus, in the context of the $L_X-\\sigma$ relation for present-day clusters,\nthere is evidence for a higher velocity dispersion at fixed X-ray luminosity.\n  A key question is whether the high velocity dispersions are indicative of the\ngravitational potential. If they are, the X-ray luminosities measured in Bower\net al., 1994 (Paper I), would then imply an implausibly low efficiency of X-ray\ngeneration. Alternatively, the discrepancy could be explained if the clusters\nwere systems of lower virial temperature, in which the apparent velocity\ndispersion is inflated by an infalling, unrelaxed halo. This might result\neither from an increase with redshift in the infall rate for clusters, or from\nthe preferential selection of clusters embedded in filaments oriented along the\nline of sight.

They can arise because of an underlying random\nmultiplicative process. For this, a theory of extreme deviations is developed,\ndevoted to the far tail of the pdf of the sum $X$ of a finite number $n$ of\nindependent random variables with a common pdf $e^{-f(x)}$. The function $f(x)$\nis chosen (i) such that the pdf is normalized and (ii) with a strong convexity\ncondition that $f''(x)>0$ and that $x^2f''(x)\\to +\\infty$ for $|x|\\to\\infty$.\nAdditional technical conditions ensure the control of the variations of\n$f''(x)$. The tail behavior of the sum comes then mostly from individual\nvariables in the sum all close to $X/n$ and the tail of the pdf is $\\sim\ne^{-nf(X/n)}$. This theory is then applied to products of independent random\nvariables, such that their logarithms are in the above class, yielding usually\nstretched exponential tails. An application to fragmentation is developed and\ncompared to data from fault gouges. The pdf by mass is obtained as a weighted\nsuperposition of stretched exponentials, reflecting the coexistence of\ndifferent fragmentation generations. For sizes near and above the peak size,\nthe pdf is approximately log-normal, while it is a power law for the smaller\nfragments, with an exponent which is a decreasing function of the peak fragment\nsize. The anomalous relaxation of glasses can also be rationalized using our\nresult together with a simple multiplicative model of local atom\nconfigurations.

We\ninvestigate two promising sub-processes: technipion plus W-boson via\ngluon-gluon fusion and technipion plus quark production via quark gluon\ninteraction. The decay chain of technipion to top plus bottom quarks and then\ntop to W plus bottom yields final states for the two subprocesses with,\nrespectively, two W's and two bottom quarks and one W, two bottom quarks and a\nlight quark. We calculate the total cross sections and the $p_{T}$\ndistributions for these technipion production mechanisms at Tevatron and LHC\nenergies for a range of technipion masses, starting at 200 GeV. We study the\nbackgrounds to our processes and the kinematic cuts that enhance the signal to\nbackground ratio and we report event rate estimates for the upgraded Tevatron\nand the LHC. Only the LHC has the potential to observe these processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 1997 23:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}
