Corresponding to the\nlaws of optics the absorption is connected with an impulse transfer that\nproduces the repulsive force. If, however, m1 and m2 are embedded in the\ngravitational radiation produced by all the masses of the universe the\nabsorption by m1 and m2 leads to a reduction of the intensity of the\ngravitational radiation between them, thus creating an attractive force exactly\nas described by Newton's law. The so called universal gravitational constant is\nno constant. It locally depends on the arrangement of the masses in the\nuniverse. It can accept high values which are usually explained by the\nexistence of dark matter. Due to the primary forces of repulsive nature between\nall masses the expansion of the universe is an intrinsic property. The balance\nbetween primary, repulsive and secondary, attractive gravitational forces can\nstabilize highly concentrated mass accumulations as they are observed in\nglobular clusters and the bulges of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 May 1997 15:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
