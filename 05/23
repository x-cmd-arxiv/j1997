The first part of the\ncourse is concerned with purely kinematic aspects: it is shown how, to second\ndifferential order, the geometry (and in particular the inner and outer\ncurvature) of a brane worldsheet of arbitrary dimension is describable in terms\nof the first, second, and third fundamental tensor; the extension to a\nfoliation by a congruence of such worldsheets is also briefly discussed. In the\nnext part, it is shown how -- to lowest order in the thin limit -- the\nevolution of such a brane worldsheet will always be governed by a simple\ntensorial equation of motion whose left hand side is the contraction of the\nsecond fundamental tensor with the relevant surface stress tensor, while the\nright hand side will simply vanish in the case of free motion and will\notherwise be just the orthogonal projection of any external force density that\nmay happen to act on the brane. (Allowance for first order deviations from such\na thin limit treatment would require evolution equations of a more complicated\nkind of which a prototype example is presented.)

The\nresulting potential - obtained in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation - is in\nqualitative agreement with phenomenological potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 1997 10:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
