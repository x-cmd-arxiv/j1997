Differential\ndecay rates for each helicity state of the four lightest excited $D$ mesons\n($D_1$, $D_2^*$, $D_0^*$, and $D_1^*$) are examined. At zero recoil,\n$\\Lambda_{QCD}/m_Q$ corrections to the matrix elements of the weak currents can\nbe written in terms of the leading Isgur-Wise functions for the corresponding\ntransition and meson mass splittings. A model independent prediction is found\nfor the slope parameter of the decay rate into helicity zero $D_1$ at zero\nrecoil. The differential decay rates are predicted, including\n$\\Lambda_{QCD}/m_Q$ corrections with some model dependence away from zero\nrecoil and including order $\\alpha_s$ corrections. Ratios of various exclusive\nbranching ratios are computed. Matrix elements of the weak currents between $B$\nmesons and other excited charmed mesons are discussed at zero recoil to order\n$\\Lambda_{QCD}/m_Q$. These amplitudes vanish at leading order, and can be\nwritten at order $\\Lambda_{QCD}/m_Q$ in terms of local matrix elements.\nApplications to $B$ decay sum rules and factorization are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 1997 02:23:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 1997 20:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-09"}

Finally, thermal emission of direct photons from the fluid of\nproduced particles is calculated within the three-fluid model and two other\nsimple expansion models. It is shown that the transverse momentum and rapidity\nspectra of photons give clue to the cooling law and the early rapidity\ndistribution of the photon source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 1997 12:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

It is shown that even\nthough the mass of the $\\omega$-meson decreases with temperature, its decay\nwidth increases because of an interesting interplay between the phase space\nfactors, the transition matrix element and Bose enhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 1997 12:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The detectors used in the experiment are ideal and the\nobservers who decide which pair of measuring devices to choose for a given pair\nof particles have free will. The construction uses random variables which are\nnot jointly measurable in a single run of an experiment and the hidden\nvariables have a nonsymmetric probability density. Such random variables are\ncomplementary but still fully classical. An assumption that classical random\nvariables cannot satisfy any form of complementarity principle is false, and\nthis is the loophole used in this example. A relationship to the detector\ninefficiency loophole is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 1997 12:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
