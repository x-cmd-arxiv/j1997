The formalism is a power spectrum method, using spherical\ncoordinates, allowing the distorting effects of galaxy peculiar velocities to\nbe calculated to linear order on the assumption of statistical isotropy but\nwithout further approximation. In this paper, we calculate the measured\ntwo-dimensional power for a constant declination strip, widely used in redshift\nsurveys. We present a likelihood method for estimating the three-dimensional\nreal-space power spectrum and the redshift distortion simultaneously, and show\nthat for thin surveys of reasonable depth, the large-scale 3D power cannot be\nmeasured with high accuracy. The redshift distortion may be estimated\nsuccessfully, and with higher accuracy if the 3D power spectrum can be measured\nindependently, for example from a large-scale sky-projected catalogue.

This effort, though\nfruitless in its original intent, nevertheless was useful in leading the way to\nEinstein's general relativity, a purely two-tensor field theory. However, a\nuniversally coupled scalar field again appeared, both in the context of Dirac's\nlarge number hypothesis and in five dimensional unified field theories as\nstudied by Fierz, Jordan, and others. While later experimentation seems to\nindicate that if such a scalar exists its influence on solar system size\ninteractions is negligible, other reincarnations have been proposed under the\nguise of dilatons in string theory and inflatons in cosmology.

The initial\nhypersurface data typically used for computation is based on mathematical\nsimplifying prescriptions, such as conformal flatness of the 3-geometry and\nlongitudinality of the extrinsic curvature. In the case of head on collisions\nof equal mass holes, there is evidence that such prescriptions work reasonably\nwell, but it is not clear why, or whether this success is more generally valid.\nHere we study these questions by considering the ``particle limit'' for head on\ncollisions of nonspinning holes. Einstein's equations are linearized in the\nmass of the small hole, and described by a single gauge invariant spacetime\nfunction psi, for each multipole. The resulting equations have been solved by\nnumerical evolution for collisions starting from various initial separations,\nand the evolution is studied on a sequence of hypersurfaces. In particular, we\nextract hypersurface data, that is psi and its time derivative, on surfaces of\nconstant background Schwarzschild time. These evolved data can then be compared\nwith ``prescribed'' data, evolved data can be replaced by prescribed data on\nany hypersurface, and evolved further forward in time, a gauge invariant\nmeasure of deviation from conformal flatness can be evaluated, etc. The main\nfindings of this study are: (i) For holes of unequal mass the use of prescribed\ndata on late hypersurfaces is not successful. (ii) The failure is likely due to\nthe inability of the prescribed data to represent the near field of the smaller\nhole. (iii) The discrepancy in the extrinsic curvature is more important than\nin the 3-geometry.

The total is an isolated\nsystem of fixed energy. This is relevant for cosmology in that the universe is\nan isolated system which we take to be homogeneous and isotropic. Furthermore,\nin virtue of the constraint which arises from reparametrization invariance of\ntime, it has total energy zero. Therefore the momentum of the scale factor is\ndetermined from the energy of matter.
