We address this problem\nboth numerically and experimentally. Two alternative ways to improve\ncommunication with chaos over band-limited channels are investigated.

A generalized Slater approximation is used for the density\nmatrix where an effective local Fermi momentum is chosen such that the next to\nleading order off-diagonal term is canceled. Hartree-Fock equations are derived\nincorporating the momentum structure of the underlying finite range\ninteraction. For applications a density dependent effective interaction is\ndetermined from a G-matrix which is renormalized such that the saturation\nproperties of symmetric nuclear matter are reproduced. Intending applications\nto systems far off stability special attention is paid to the low density\nregime and asymmetric nuclear matter. Results are compared to predictions\nobtained from Skyrme interactions. The ground state properties of stable nuclei\nare well reproduced without further adjustments of parameters. The potential of\nthe approach is further exemplified in calculations for A=100...140 tin\nisotopes. Rather extended neutron skins are found beyond 130Sn corresponding to\nsolid layers of neutron matter surrounding a core of normal composition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 1997 13:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
