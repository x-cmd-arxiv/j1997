In agreement with optical searches in the halo, no evidence was found\nfor extensive star-forming activity inside the high-latitude HVCs.\nSpecifically, we have found no signs of star formation or YSOs in the direction\nof the A IV cloud or in the very-high-velocity clouds HVC~110-7-465 and\nHVC~114-10-440. We have identified only one young star in the direction of the\nM~I.1 cloud, which shows almost perfect alignment with a knot of \\HI emission.\nBecause of the small number of early-type stars observed in the halo, the\nprobability for such a positional coincidence is low; thus, this young star\nappears to be physically associated with the M~I.1 cloud. We have also\nidentified a good YSO candidate in the \\HI shell-like structure observed in the\ncore region of the low-latitude cloud complex H (HVC~131+1-200). This region\ncould be a supernova remnant with several other YSO candidates formed along the\nshock front produced by the explosion. In agreement with recent theoretical\nestimates, these results point to a low but significant star-formation rate in\nintermediate and high Galactic latitude HVCs. For M~I.1 in particular, we\nestimate that the efficiency of the star-formation process is $M(YSO)/M(\\HI)\\ga\n10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ by mass. Such efficiency is sufficient to account for (a) the\nexistence of the few young blue stars whose ages imply that they were born in\nthe Galactic halo, and (b) the nonprimordial metallicities inferred for some\nHVCs if their metal content proves to be low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 May 1997 19:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Moreover,\nit is assumed that the matrix elements of the residual interaction, obtained\nafter the average interaction is removed, are random with the average value of\nzero. With these two assumptions one obtains explicit expressions for the mean\nfield and the fluctuation away from the average. The fluctuation is expanded in\nterms of more and more complex excitations. Using the randomness of the matrix\nelements one can then obtain formulas for the contribution to the error from\neach class of complex excitations and a general condition for the convergence\nof the expansion is derived. It is to be emphasized that no conditions on the\nnature of the system being studied are made. Making some simplifying\nassumptions a schematic model is developed. This model is applied to the\nproblem of nuclear matter. The model yields a measure of the strength of the\neffective interaction. It turns out to be three orders of magnitude less than\nthat calculated using a potential which gives a binding energy of about -7\nMeV/nucleon demonstrating the strong damping of the interaction strength\ninduced by the averaging process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 1997 10:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

This\nbehavior is consistent with the behavior of a stochastic differential equation\nfor soil moisture at a point. This behavior has important consequences for the\nfrequency-size distribution of landslides. We present the cumulative\nfrequency-size distributions of landslides induced by precipitation in Japan\nand Bolivia as well as landslides triggered by the 1994 Northridge, California\nearthquake. Large landslides in these regions, despite being triggered by\ndifferent mechanisms, have a cumulative frequency-size distribution with a\npower-law dependence on area with an exponent ranging from -1.5 to -2.
