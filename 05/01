Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a\nnumber, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the\nanswer to a network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest.\nIt appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms\nfor exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using\nclustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a\nQ-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the\ninference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation\nalgorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a\nstandard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended\nvalue of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to\nutilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The proposed\nframework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different\nsoftware and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation\nalgorithm. Interestingly enough, Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes:\nsimple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex\noptimization techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning\nand computation-caching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 1997 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

Differentiability properties for the bending measured lamination are\nconceptually less simple, because the space ML(S) of measured geodesic\nlaminations on S has no natural differentiable structure.

In the\nsecond half of the talk we discuss experimental data on collective flow in\nheavy ion collision, its hydro-based description and relation to equation of\nstate (EOS). A distinct feature of the QCD phase transition region is high\ndegree of ``softness'', (small ratio pressure/energy density).\n  We present some preliminary results indicated that it is indeed needed to\nexplain the radial flow at SPS energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 1997 17:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

In this paper we describe the perturbative approach\nto reheating, and then concentrate on effects beyond the perturbation theory.\nThey are related to the stage of parametric resonance called preheating. It may\noccur in an expanding universe if the initial amplitude of oscillations of the\ninflaton field is large enough. We investigate a simple model of a massive\ninflaton field coupled to another scalar field X. Parametric resonance in this\nmodel is very broad. It occurs in a very unusual stochastic manner, which is\ndifferent from the parametric resonance in the case when the expansion of the\nuniverse is neglected. Quantum fields interacting with the oscillating inflaton\nfield experience a series of kicks which occur with phases uncorrelated to each\nother. We call this process stochastic resonance. We develop the theory of\npreheating taking into account the expansion of the universe and backreaction\nof produced particles, including the effects of rescattering. The process of\npreheating can be divided into several distinct stages. At the first stage the\nbackreaction of created particles is not important. At the second stage\nbackreaction increases the frequency of oscillations of the inflaton field,\nwhich makes the process even more efficient than before. Then the effects\nrelated to scattering of X-particles terminate the resonance. We calculate the\ndensity of X-particles and their quantum fluctuations with all backreaction\neffects taken into account. This allows us to find the range of masses and\ncoupling constants for which one has efficient preheating. In particular, under\ncertain conditions this process may produce particles with a mass much greater\nthan the mass of the inflaton field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 1997 18:17:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 1997 01:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

We derive a model of the dynamics of\nthe film, the model being expressed in terms of the film thickness and the\ncurvature tensor of the substrate. The model accurately includes the effects of\nthe curvature of the substrate, via a physical multiple-scale approach, and\ngravity and inertia, via more rigorous centre manifold techniques. Numerical\nsimulations exhibit some generic features of the dynamics of such thin fluid\nfilms on substrates with complex curvature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 1997 08:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Examination of high accuracy ab-initio\nsolutions for several small molecules suggests that the Laplacian of Bader and\nthe quantum potential of Bohm are structurally equivalent.
