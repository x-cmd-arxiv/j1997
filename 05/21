Extreme conditions in gamma ray bursters lead to\nhighly relativistic motions (bulk Lorentz factors Gamma > 100).

We explore the sensitivity of the\nresults to values of these parameters, and reach the following conclusions.\nOld, metal rich galaxies, such as giant ellipticals, naturally develop a UV\nupturn within a reasonable time scale - less than a Hubble time - without the\npresence of young stars. The most likely stars to dominate the UV flux of such\npopulations are low mass, core helium burning (HB and evolved HB) stars.\nMetal-poor populations produce a higher ratio of UV-to-V flux, due to opacity\neffects, but only metal-rich stars develop a UV upturn, in which the flux\nincreases towards shorter UV wavelengths. Model color-magnitude diagrams and\ncorresponding integrated spectra (for various values of age, metallicity,\nhelium enrichment, mass loss efficiency, initial mass function, and the HB mass\ndispersion factor) are available on S.Y.'s world wide web site\nhttp://shemesh.gsfc.nasa.gov/model.html.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 1997 14:42:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 May 1997 15:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}
