However, the relative frequency of tidal\ncollisions does not seem large enough (compared to that of the clusters with\npure RHBs) to account for such a drastic difference in HB morphology.

Recent\nexperiments have shown a strong dependence of the Raman signal in $B_{1g}$\ngeometry on the frequency of the incoming photon. We present an analytical and\nnumerical study of the Raman intensity in the resonant regime. It has been\npreviously argued by one of us (A.Ch) and D. Frenkel that the most relevant\ncontribution to the Raman vertex at resonance is given by the triple resonance\ndiagram. We derive an expression for the Raman intensity in which we\nsimultaneously include the enhancement due to the triple resonance and a final\nstate interaction. We compute the two-magnon peak height (TMPH) as a function\nof incident frequency and find two maxima at $\\omega^{(1)}_{res} \\approx\n2\\Delta + 3J$ and $\\omega^{(2)}_{res} \\approx 2\\Delta + 8J$. We argue that the\nhigh-frequency maximum is cut only by a quasiparticle damping, while the\nlow-frequency maximum has a finite amplitude even in the absence of damping. We\nalso obtain an evolution of the Raman profile from an asymmetric form around\n$\\omega^{(1)}_{res}$ to a symmetric form around $\\omega^{(2)}_{res}$.

A resonant symmetric structure\nis proposed as an extension of Bardeen Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) theory,\nwhich suspends Lorentz transforms at superluminal velocities in the context of\nthe de Broglie hypothesis. A momentum and energy conserving (elastic) CPT\nresonant structural lattice scalable over 15 orders of magnitude from nuclear\nto universe dimensions and associated superconducting theory is postulated\nwhereby nuclear (quark) weak and strong forces, electromagnetic and\ngravitational forces are mediated by a particle of resonant velocity\ntransformed mass (mt) (110.123 x electron mass or 56 Mev/c2), The universe mass\nand density are based on an isotropic homogeneous media filling the vacuum of\nand could be considered a candidate for dark matter/energy. The model predicts\na deceleration value consistent with observed Pioneer 10 and 11 deep space\ntranslational and rotational deceleration and consistent with the notion that,\nAn object moving through momentum space will slow down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 1997 20:13:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 May 1997 22:11:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 1997 22:26:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 1997 18:53:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 1997 19:13:23 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2005 21:32:03 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2007 22:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
