This theory\nencompasses most of the mass/age parameter space occupied by substellar objects\nand is the first spectral study down to 100 K. These calculations are in aid of\nthe multitude of searches being conducted or planned around the world for giant\nplanets and brown dwarfs and reveal the exotic nature of the class.\nGenerically, absorption by H_2 at longer wavelengths and H_2O opacity windows\nat shorter wavelengths conspire to redistribute flux blueward. Below 1200 K,\nmethane is the dominant carbon bearing molecule and is a universal diagnostic\nfeature of EGP and brown dwarf spectra. We find that the primary bands in which\nto search are $Z$ (\\sim 1.05 \\mic), $J$ (\\sim 1.2 \\mic), $H$ (\\sim 1.6 \\mic),\n$K$ (\\sim 2.2 \\mic), $M$ (\\sim 5 \\mic), and $N$ (\\sim 10 \\mic), that\nenhancements of the emergent flux over blackbody values, in particular in the\nnear infrared, can be by many orders of magnitude, and that the infrared colors\nof EGPs and brown dwarfs are much bluer than previously believed. In\nparticular, relative to $J$ and $H$, the $K$ band flux is reduced by CH_4 and\nH_2 absorption. Furthermore, we derive that for T_{eff}s below 1200 K most or\nall true metals are sequestered below the photosphere, that an interior\nradiative zone is a generic feature of substellar objects, and that clouds of\nH_2O and NH_3 are formed for T_{eff}s below \\sim 400 K and \\sim 200 K,\nrespectively. This study is done for solar-metallicity objects in isolation and\ndoes not include the effects of stellar insolation. Nevertheless, it is an\nattempt to bridge the gap between the planetary and stellar realms and to\ndevelop a non-gray theory of objects from 0.3 \\mj (``saturn'') to 70 \\mj\n($\\sim$0.07 \\mo).
