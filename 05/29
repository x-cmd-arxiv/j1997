We have studied this transition in the kinetic Ising Model in\ntwo dimension using Monte Carlo technique, and solved numerically the mean\nfield equation of motion. The transition is essentially dynamic in nature and\nit takes the system from one ordered equilibrium phase to another by means of\nthe growth of opposite spin domains (in the kinetic Ising case) induced during\nthe period when the pulsed field is applied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 1997 11:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

In order for the normal form to carry\nuseful information about the biholomorphic equivalence class, we shall require\nthat the transformation to normal form is unique modulo some finite dimensional\ngroup. A classical result due to Chern--Moser gives such a normal form for Levi\nnondegenerate hypersurfaces.\n  The main results in this paper concern real-analytic hypersurfaces $M$ in\n$\\Bbb C^3$ at certain Levi degenerate points $p_0\\in M$, namely points at which\n$M$ is 2-nondegenerate.
