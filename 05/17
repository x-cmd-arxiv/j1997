In particular, the so called\ncorrelation length $r_{0}$ is shown to be simply a fraction of the sample size.\nMoreover we conclude that galaxies and clusters are two different\nrepresentations of the same self similar structure and that the correlations of\nclusters are the continuation of those of galaxies to larger scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 1997 16:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-17"}

This method, applied here primarily in the R\nband, is based on the surface brightness fluctuations technique of\nextragalactic distance measurement. The sample galaxies range in redshift from\n5000 to 10,000 \\kms, and were selected primarily from the Lauer & Postman\n(1994) survey of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs).\n  We find a tight correlation between the GC specific frequency S_N of the\ncentral bright galaxy in the cluster and the cluster velocity dispersion. S_N\nalso correlates well with the cluster X-ray temperature and with the number of\nbright neighboring galaxies, less well with the galaxy profile, and only\nmarginally with galaxy luminosity and overall cluster richness. It does not\ncorrelate with cluster morphology class. Thus, unlike galaxy luminosity, S_N is\ndetermined by the cluster mass, or density. To account for this situation, we\npropose that the GCs formed early and in proportion to the available mass,\nwhile the luminosity growth of the galaxy was later halted, yielding the\nobserved correlations of S_N with density. We introduce a quantity called\n$\\eta_{GC}$, the number of GCs per unit local cluster mass. For a simple\ncluster mass model, $\\eta_{GC}$ is found to be constant, indicating a uniform\nGC production rate per unit available mass.\n  A measurement of the Gaussian width $\\sigma$ of the GC luminosity function\n(GCLF) is one of the byproducts of our analysis.
