The\nfirst method is a direct perturbation theory in 1/N using the path integral.\nThe second solves exactly the theory defined by the effective action to order\n1/N. We compare the results of both methods as a function of N. At N=1, where\nwe expect the expansion to be quite innacurate, we compare our results to an\nexact numerical solution of the Schroedinger equation. In this case we find\nthat when the two methods disagree they also diverge from the exact answer. We\nalso find at N=1 that the 1/N corrected evolutions track the exact answer for\nthe expectation values much longer than the mean field (N= \\infty) result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 1997 15:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
