By recalling that charge\nconjugation of particles into antiparticles is anti-automorphic, the proposed\ntheory of antimatter is based on a new map, called isoduality, which is also\nanti-automorphic, yet it is applicable beginning at the classical level and\nthen persists at the quantum level. As part of our study, we present novel\nanti-isomorphic isodual images of the Galilean, special and general\nrelativities and show the compatibility of their representation of antimatter\nwith all available classical experimental knowledge, that on electromagnetic\ninteractions. We also identify the prediction of antigravity for antimatter in\nthe field of matter (or vice-versa) without any claim on its validity, and\ndefer its resolution to specific experiments. To avoid a prohibitive length,\nthe paper is restricted to the classical treatment which had not been\nsufficiently treated until now. Studies on operator profiles, such as the\nequivalence of isoduality and charge conjugation and the implication of the\nisodual theory in particle physics, are conducted in a separate paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 1997 11:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
