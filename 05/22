When originally discovered in 1991, the red peak of the\ndouble-peaked H-alpha line was stronger than the blue, while by 1994 the\nH-alpha profile had become almost symmetric and the integrated line flux had\ndecreased to half its original value. Our new spectrum, taken in 1996, shows\nthat the broad, double-peaked lines have returned to almost their original\nstrengths, the profiles of H-beta and H-alpha are identical to within errors,\nand the broad-line emitting region is unreddened. However, the profile of the\nBalmer lines is now such that the blue peak is stronger than the red, opposite\nto the asymmetry observed in 1991. Various models are considered for the\nobserved behavior, all assuming that the emission lines originate in an\naccretion disk. We present a refined version of the precessing, planar,\nelliptical accretion ring model proposed by Storchi-Bergmann et al. and\nEracleous et al. This model provides an acceptable fit to the line profiles. We\nalso consider the possibility that the line profile evolution results from a\nprecessing warp in the disk, induced by irradiation from the center, and show\nthat the range of radii and precession time scales expected in this model are\nconsistent with the observations. The sudden appearance of the \"disk-like\"\nbroad line profiles in NGC 1097 could have resulted from the formation of a new\naccretion disk due to, for example, the tidal disruption of a star, or the\nillumination of a pre-existing disk by a transient ionizing source at the\ncenter of the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 1997 23:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The model we consider is the uniformly\nfrustrated anisotropic Villain Model. In zero magnetic field, and for all\nanisotropies considered, we find one single second order phase transition,\nmediated by an Onsager vortex-loop blowout. This is the superconductor-normal\nmetal transition.A comparison with numerical simulations and a critical scaling\nanalysis of the zero-field loop-transition yields the same exponent of the loop\ndistribution function at the critical point. In the intermediate magnetic field\nregime, we find two anomalies in the specific heat. The first anomaly at a\ntemperature $T_m$ is associated with the melting transition of the flux-line\nlattice. The second anomaly at a temperature $T_z$ is one where phase coherence\nalong the field direction is destroyed. We argue that $T_m=T_z$ in the\nthermodynamic and continuum limit. Hence, there is no regime where the flux\nline lattice melts into a disentangled flux-line liquid. The loss of phase\ncoherence parallel to the magnetic field in the sample is argued to be due to\nthe proliferation of closed non-field induced vortex loops on the scale of the\nmagnetic length in the problem, resulting in flux-line cutting and\nrecombination. In the flux-line liquid phase, therefore, flux-lines appear no\nlonger to be well defined entities. A finite-size scaling analysis of the delta\nfunction peak specific heat anomaly at the melting transition is used to\nextract the discontinuity of the entropy at the melting transition.This entropy\ndiscontinuity is found to increase rapidly with mass-anisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 1997 09:12:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 1997 14:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
