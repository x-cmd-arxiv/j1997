This singularity in $\\rho (r)$ can be\nconsidered to be consistent with the socalled Big Bang theory of the universe.\nBy assuming that Mach's principle holds good in the evolution of the universe,\nwe determine the number of particles, $N$, of the universe and its $R_0$, which\nare obtained in terms of the mass $m$ of the constituent particles and the\nUniversal Gravitational constant $G$ only.
