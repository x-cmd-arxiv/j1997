In particular we\nhave investigated the impact of the four main sources of uncertainty in\nderiving physical quantities from such data, namely i) potential contamination\nby galactic cirrus, ii) uncertainty in the value of the dust rest-frequency\nmass-absorption coefficient, iii) difficulty in constraining the dust\ntemperature, and iv) estimation of the appropriate gas:dust ratio in\nhigh-redshift objects.

These\nfeatures, coupled with the failure to detect any spectral signatures of old\nstars at $z > 1$, has led to the suggestion that these galaxies are being\nobserved close to or even during a general epoch of formation. However, we have\nrecently demonstrated that radio selection at significantly fainter (mJy) flux\ndensities can be used to identify apparently passively evolving elliptical\ngalaxies at high redshift. Deep Keck spectra have now been obtained for two\nsuch objects yielding absorption line redshifts $z \\simeq 1.5$; 53W091 at $z =\n1.552$ (Dunlop et al. 1996) and most recently 53W069 at $z = 1.432$. The\nultraviolet SEDs of these galaxies indicate minimum ages $> 3$ Gyr while, as\nstressed in this article, the strength of the reddenning-independent\nultraviolet spectral breaks actually indicate a greater minimum age of 5 Gyr\nfor both objects assuming solar metallicity. Since the spectra comprise the\nintegrated light of each galaxy to radii greater than $r_e$, I argue that it is\ndifficult to justify the adoption of significantly super-solar metallicity in\ninterpreting these data. It thus seems hard to escape the conclusion that\n$\\Omega_0 < 1$ and that, irrespective of the adopted cosmology, at least some\nmassive ellipitical galaxies were formed at high redshift ($z> 5$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 1997 11:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The amplitude and the\nalpha and M^* parameters of our luminosity function are in good agreement with\nthose of the AUTOFIB redshift survey (Ellis et al. 1996).

For some vacuum\ngravitational systems in which there exists an intrinsic time variable which is\nnot invariant under constant rescalings of the metric, we show that, after such\na choice of time gauge and with a certain identification of parameters, the\ngeneralized Wick transform can be understood as an analytic continuation in the\nexplicit time dependence. This result is rigorously proved for the Gowdy model\nwith the topology of a three-torus and for a whole class of cosmological models\nthat describe expanding universes. In these gravitational systems, the analytic\ncontinuation that reproduces the generalized Wick transform after gauge fixing\nturns out to map the Euclidean line element to the Lorentzian one multiplied by\nan imaginary factor; this transformation rule differs from that expected for an\ninverse Wick rotation in a complex rescaling of the four-metric. We then prove\nthat this transformation rule for the line element continues to be valid in the\nmost general case of vacuum gravity with no model reduction nor gauge fixing.\nIn this general case, it is further shown that the action of the generalized\nWick transform on any function of the gravitational phase space variables, the\nshift vector, and the lapse function can in fact be interpreted as the result\nof an inverse Wick rotation and a constant, imaginary conformal transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 1997 15:42:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 1998 07:43:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 1998 18:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

As the\n$p$-brane passes through the $(8-p)$-brane, the connecting string changes\ndirection, which may be interpreted as creation of one fundamental string.
