Treating\nall hydrogen degrees of freedom as dynamical coordinates implies a high\ndimensionality and requires statistical averages over thousands of\ntrajectories. An efficient and accurate treatment of such extensive statistics\nis achieved in two steps: In a first step we evaluate the ab initio potential\nenergy surface (PES) and determine an analytical representation. Then, in an\nindependent second step dynamical calculations are performed on the analytical\nrepresentation of the PES. Thus the dissociation dynamics is investigated\nwithout any crucial assumption except for the Born-Oppenheimer approximation\nwhich is anyhow employed when density-functional theory calculations are\nperformed. The ab initio molecular dynamics is compared to detailed quantum\ndynamical calculations on exactly the same ab initio PES. The occurence of\nquantum oscillations in the sticking probability as a function of kinetic\nenergy is addressed. They turn out to be very sensitive to the symmetry of the\ninitial conditions. At low kinetic energies sticking is dominated by the\nsteering effect which is illustrated using classical trajectories. The steering\neffects depends on the kinetic energy, but not on the mass of the molecules.\nZero-point effects lead to strong differences between quantum and classical\ncalculations of the sticking probability. The dependence of the sticking\nprobability on the angle of incidence is analysed; it is found to be in good\nagreement with experimental data. The results show that the determination of\nthe potential energy surface combined with high-dimensional dynamical\ncalculations, in which all relevant degrees of freedon are taken into account,\nleads to a detailed understanding of the dissociation dynamics of hydrogen at a\ntransition metal surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 1997 10:20:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The scheme is made of simple\noptical elements, as laser sources, beam splitters, and phase sensitive\namplifiers, along with a feedback mechanism that uses a Pockels cell. We show\nthat the von Neumann measurement is achieved without the need of working in a\nultra-short pulsed regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 1997 14:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

In both cases the investigation is based on the study of the\nsingularities of the system (the Painlev\\'e method for ODE's and the\nsingularity confinement method for mappings).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 1997 15:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
