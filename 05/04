We construct a numerical invariant\ncalled the size of a fibration which arises as the solution of certain\nvariational problems closely related to Hofer's geometry, K-area and coupling.\nIn some examples it can be computed with the use of Gromov-Witten invariants.\nThe link between these two themes is given by an observation that the first\neigenvalue of a Riemannian metric compatible with a symplectic fibration admits\na universal upper bound in terms of the size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 May 1997 14:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
