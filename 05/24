The cross\nsection is sensitive to inclination and dominated by edge-on galaxies, which\nproduce lenses with an unobserved 2-image geometry and a smaller number of\nstandard 5-image lenses. Unless the disk is unreasonably massive, disk+halo\nmodels averaged over inclination predict \\lesssim 10% more lenses than pure\nhalo models. Finally, models with an exponential disk and a central bulge are\nsensitive to the properties of the bulge. In particular, an exponential disk\nmodel normalized to our Galaxy cannot produce multiple images without a bulge,\nand including a bulge reduces the net flattening of edge-on galaxies.

An analysis by Tegmark et al.
