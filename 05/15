We use a non-linear Monte Carlo code to perform\nthe calculations. As an example, we discuss models where the corona is situated\nabove and below a cold accretion disk with a plane-parallel (slab) geometry,\nsimilar to the model of Haardt and Maraschi. By Comptonizing the soft radiation\nemitted by the accretion disk, the corona is responsible for producing the\nhigh-energy component of the escaping radiation. Our models include the\nreprocessing of radiation in the accretion disk. Here, the photons either are\nCompton reflected or photo-absorbed, giving rise to fluorescent line emission\nand thermal emission. The self-consistent coronal temperature is determined by\nbalancing heating (due to viscous energy dissipation) with Compton cooling,\ndetermined using the fully relativistic, angle-dependent cross-sections. The\ntotal opacity is found by balancing pair productions with annihilations. We\nfind that, for a disk temperature kT_bb \\lta 200 eV, these coronae are unable\nto have a self-consistent temperature higher than \\sim 120 keV if the total\noptical depth is \\gta 0.2, regardless of the compactness parameter of the\ncorona and the seed opacity.

Finally, all models that have reprocessing features also predict\na large thermal excess at lower energies.

In the present work we consider specific examples of\nitinerant ferromagnet as well as antiferromagnet in the limit of vanishing\ntransition temperature. The temperature variation of spin susceptibility,\nelectrical resistivity, specific heat, and NMR relaxation rates at low\ntemperatures is calculated in the limit of infinite exchange enhancement within\nthe frame work of a self consistent spin fluctuation theory. The resulting\nnon-Fermi liquid behavior is due to the presence of the low lying critically\ndamped spin fluctuations in these systems. The theory presented here gives the\nleading low temperature behavior, as it turns out that the fluctuation\ncorrelation term is always smaller than the mean fluctuation field term in\nthree as well as in two space dimensions. A comparison with illustrative\nexperimental results of these properties in some typical systems has been done.\nFinally we make some remarks on the effect of disorder in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 1997 10:28:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 1997 05:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
