Previous studies have assumed that only\nmaterial outside the radius of marginal stability can contribute to the\nobserved line emission. Here, we show that fluorescence by material inside the\nradius of marginal stability, which is in the process of spiralling towards the\nevent horizon, can have a observable influence on the iron line profile and\nequivalent width. For concreteness, we consider the case of a geometrically\nthin accretion disk, around a Schwarzschild black hole, in which fluorescence\nis excited by an X-ray source placed at some height above the disk and on the\naxis of the disk. Fully relativistic line profiles are presented for various\nsource heights and efficiencies. It is found that the extra line flux generally\nemerges in the extreme red wing of the iron line, due to the large\ngravitational redshift experienced by photons from the region within the radius\nof marginal stability. We apply our models to the variable iron line seen in\nthe ASCA spectrum of the Seyfert nucleus MCG-6-30-15. It is found that the\nchange in the line profile, equivalent width, and continuum normalization, can\nbe well explained as being due to a change in the height of the source above\nthe disk.

In this lecture, we will argue\nthat some properties of the Dirac spectrum are universal and can be obtained\nfrom a random matrix theory with the global symmetries of the QCD partition\nfunction. In particular, this is true for the spectrum near zero on the scale\nof a typical level spacing. Alternatively, the chiral order parameter can be\ncharacterized by the zeros of the partition function. We will analyze such\nzeros for a random matrix model at nonzero chemical potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 1997 17:25:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Of particular\ninterest is the case when the cross-coupling between the inflaton and the\nsecond scalar field is negative, which is naturally allowed in many realistic\nmodels. While the inflaton decays via parametric resonance in the positive\ncoupling case we find that for negative coupling there is a new mechanism of\nparticle production which we call negative coupling instability. Due to this\nnew mechanism the variances of the fields grow significantly larger before the\nproduction is shut off by the backreaction of the created particles. We also\nfind that heavy particles are produced much more efficiently with negative\ncoupling, which is of prime importance for GUT baryogenesis. Using a simple toy\nmodel for baryogenesis and the results of our lattice simulations we show that\nfor natural values of the cross-coupling enough 10^{14}GeV bosons are created\nto produce a baryon to entropy ratio consistent with observation. For positive\ncoupling the value of the cross-coupling required to produce such massive\nparticles is unnaturally large. In addition to our numerical results we obtain\nanalytical estimates for the maximum variances of the fields in an expanding\nuniverse for all cases of interest in our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 1997 22:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}
