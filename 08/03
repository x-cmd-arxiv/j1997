Errors quoted are 1 sigma, and we assume Gaussian\nstatistics. We experiment with a fifth constraint Omega_o = 0.2 +- 0.1 from\nclusters. We set the tilt parameter n = 1 and the gas enhancement factor\nUpsilon = 0.9. We consider CDM models (open and Omega_M = 1) and flat LambdaCDM\nmodels. We test goodness of fit and draw confidence regions by the Delta chi^2\nmethod. CDM models with Omega_M = 1 (SCDM models) are accepted only because the\nlarge error on h_o allows h < 0.5. Baryonic matter plays a significant role in\nGamma_o when Omega_M \\sim 1. Open CDM models are accepted only for Omega_M\n\\gtrsim 0.4. The combination of the four other constraints with Omega_o = 0.2\n+- 0.1 is rejected in CDM models with 98% confidence, suggesting that light may\nnot trace mass. LambdaCDM models give similar results. In all of these models,\neta_{10} \\gtrsim 6 is favored strongly over eta_{10} \\lesssim 2. This suggests\nthat reports of low deuterium abundances on QSO lines of sight may be correct\nand that observational determinations of primordial 4He may have systematic\nerrors. Plausible variations on n and Upsilon in our models do not change the\nresults much. If we drop or change the crucial Gamma_o constraint, lower values\nof Omega_M and eta_{10} are permitted. The constraint Gamma_o = 0.15 +- 0.04,\nderived recently from the IRAS redshift survey, favors Omega_M \\approx 0.3 and\neta_{10} \\approx 5 but does not exclude eta_{10} \\approx 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 1997 18:29:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 1998 02:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
