Trace formulas establish links between the energy spectra\nof the quantum description and the spectrum of actions of periodic orbits in\nthe classical description. This duality is investigated in the present paper.\nThe duality holds for chaotic as well as for integrable systems. For billiards\nthe quantal spectrum (eigenvalues of the Helmholtz equation) and the classical\nspectrum (lengths of periodic orbits) are two manifestations of the billiard's\nboundary. The trace formula expresses this link as a Fourier transform relation\nbetween the corresponding spectral densities. It follows that the two-point\nstatistics are also simply related. The universal correlations of the quantal\nspectrum are well known, consequently one can deduce the classical universal\ncorrelations. An explicit expression for the scale of the classical\ncorrelations is derived and interpreted. This allows a further extension of the\nformalism to the case of complex billiard systems, and in particular to the\nmost interesting case of diffusive system. The concept of classical\ncorrelations allows a better understanding of the so-called diagonal\napproximation and its breakdown. It also paves the way towards a semiclassical\ntheory that is capable of global description of spectral statistics beyond the\nbreaktime. An illustrative application is the derivation of the\ndisorder-limited breaktime in case of a disordered chain, thus obtaining a\nsemiclassical theory for localization.

These constraints are presented in a canonically invariant\nform which is both concise and explicit. Since the conventional uncertainty\nprinciple is such a constraint on the first and second moments, our result\nconstitutes a generalization of the same to all orders. Possible application in\nquantum state reconstruction using optical homodyne tomography is noted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 1997 12:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
