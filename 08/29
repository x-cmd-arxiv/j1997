The observed limit is consistent with atmosphere\nmodels in which the maximum value of the ratio of the radiation force outwards\nto the gravitational force inwards, Y_max, is 0.9, i.e., the photospheres of\nstars at the observed luminosity limit are bound. As massive stars evolve, they\nmove to higher, and therefore less stable values of Y_max, so mass loss, either\nsporadic or continuous, may halt their natural redward evolution as they\napproach the Y_max = 0.9 limit.
