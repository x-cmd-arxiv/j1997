The wall motion is then determined by its coupling to phonons and\nnuclear spins, and any pinning potentials. In the absence of nuclear spins\nthere is a dominant superOhmic 1-phonon coupling to the wall velocity, plus a\nstrongly T-dependent Ohmic coupling to pairs of phonons. There is also a\nT-independent Ohmic coupling between single phonons and the wall chirality,\nwhich suppresses ``chirality tunneling''. We calculate the effect of these\ncouplings on the T-dependent tunneling rate of a wall out of a pinning\npotential. Nuclear spins have a very strong and hitherto unsuspected influence\non domain wall dynamics, coming from a hyperfine-mediated coupling to the\ndomain wall position. For $k_B T \\gg \\omega_{0}$ this coupling yields a\nspatially random potential, fluctuating at a rate governed by the nuclear\n$T_2$. When $k_B T \\ll \\omega_{0}$, the hyperfine potential fluctuates around a\nlinear binding potential. The wall dynamics is influenced by the fluctuations\nof this potential, ie., by the nuclear spin dynamics. Wall tunneling can occur\nwhen fluctuations open an occasional ``tunneling window''. This changes the\ncrossover to tunneling and also causes a slow \"wandering\", in time, of the\nenergy levels associated with domain wall motion inside the pinning potential.\nThis effect is fairly weak in $Ni$- and $Fe$- based magnets, and we give an\napproximate treatment of its effect on the tunneling dynamics, as well as a\ndiscussion of the relationship to recent domain wall tunneling experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 1997 14:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
