In this chapter, I argue that the restriction of centering to\noperating within a discourse segment should be abandoned in order to integrate\ncentering with a model of global discourse structure. The within-segment\nrestriction causes three problems. The first problem is that centers are often\ncontinued over discourse segment boundaries with pronominal referring\nexpressions whose form is identical to those that occur within a discourse\nsegment. The second problem is that recent work has shown that listeners\nperceive segment boundaries at various levels of granularity. If centering\nmodels a universal processing phenomenon, it is implausible that each listener\nis using a different centering algorithm.The third issue is that even for\nutterances within a discourse segment, there are strong contrasts between\nutterances whose adjacent utterance within a segment is hierarchically recent\nand those whose adjacent utterance within a segment is linearly recent. This\nchapter argues that these problems can be eliminated by replacing Grosz and\nSidner's stack model of attentional state with an alternate model, the cache\nmodel. I show how the cache model is easily integrated with the centering\nalgorithm, and provide several types of data from naturally occurring\ndiscourses that support the proposed integrated model. Future work should\nprovide additional support for these claims with an examination of a larger\ncorpus of naturally occurring discourses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 1997 21:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

We demonstrate the\nexistence of the ``transverse critical force'' at T=0. A ``static random\nforce'' is shown to be generated by motion.

In six dimensions, we compute the relevant perturbative\ncorrections for the type II string compactified on K3. In four dimensions we do\nanalogous computations for several models with (4,0) and (2,2) supersymmetry.\nSuch ground states are related by heterotic-type II duality or type II-type II\nU-duality. Perturbative computations in one member of a dual pair give a\nnon-perturbative result in the other member. In particular, the exact CP-even\nR^2 coupling on the (2,2) side reproduces the tree-level term plus NS 5-brane\ninstanton contributions on the (4,0) side.

In a subset of models, the expected breaking of the\nSL(2,Z)_S S-duality symmetry to a \\Gamma(2)_S subgroup is observed on the\nnon-perturbative thresholds.
