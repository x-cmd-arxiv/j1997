The galaxy distribution within Corona Borealis is clumpy and\nappears overall to be far from relaxed. A background supercluster at z ~ 0.11\nmakes a substantial contribution to the projected surface density of galaxies\nin the Corona Borealis field. In order to estimate the mass of the\nsupercluster, we have assumed that the mass of the supercluster is proportional\nto v^2r, where v and r are suitable scale velocity and radius, respectively,\nand we have used N-body simulations of both critical- and low-density universes\nto determine the applicability of standard mass estimators based on this\nassumption. Although superclusters are obviously not in equilibrium, our\nsimulations demonstrate that the virial mass estimator yields mass estimates\nwith an insignificant bias and a dispersion of only ~25% for objects with\noverdensities >~ 5. Non-uniform spatial sampling can, however, cause systematic\nunderestimates by as much as 30%. All of our simulated superclusters turn out\nto be bound, and based on the overdensity of the Corona Borealis supercluster,\nwe believe it is also very likely to be bound and may well have started to\ncollapse. The mass of Corona Borealis is at least 3 x 10^16 solar masses, which\nyields a B(AB)-band mass-to-light ratio of 564h (M/L)_solar on scales of ~20\nh^-1 Mpc. The background supercluster has a mass-to-light ratio of 726h\n(M/L)_solar. By comparing the supercluster mass-to-light ratios with the\ncritical mass-to-light ratio required to close the universe, we determine that\nOmega_0 >~ 0.4 on supercluster scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Aug 1997 21:28:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The system\nrequires simultaneous treatment of Markovian and non-Markovian dissipation\nprocesses, but the photonic band gap continuum can not be eliminated within a\ndensity matrix treatment. Instead we propose a formalism based on Monte-Carlo\nwavefunctions, and we present results relevant to an experimental\ncharacterization of a structured continuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Aug 1997 13:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
