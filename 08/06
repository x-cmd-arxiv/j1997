We propose that the bulk mechanical\nrelaxation modulus that has so far been ignored in previous theories plays an\nimportant role in viscoelastic phase separation in addition to the shear\nrelaxation modulus. In polymer solutions, for example, attractive interactions\nbetween polymers under a poor-solvent condition likely cause the transient\ngellike behavior, which makes both bulk and shear modes active. Although such\nattractive interactions between molecules of the same component exist\nuniversally in the two-phase region of a mixture, the stress arising from\nattractive interactions is asymmetrically divided between the components only\nin dynamically asymmetric mixtures such as polymer solutions and colloidal\nsuspensions. Thus, the interaction network between the slower components, which\ncan store the elastic energy against its deformation through bulk and shear\nmoduli, is formed. It is the bulk relaxation modulus associated with this\ninteraction network that is primarily responsible for the appearance of the\nsponge structure peculiar to viscoelastic phase separation and the phase\ninversion. We demonstrate that a viscoelastic model of phase separation\nincluding this new effect is a general model that can describe all types of\nisotropic phase separation including solid and fluid models as its special\ncases without any exception, if there is no coupling with additional order\nparameter. The physical origin of volume shrinking behavior during viscoelastic\nphase separation and the universality of the resulting spongelike structure are\nalso discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 1997 15:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
