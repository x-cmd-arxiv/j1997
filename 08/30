For an ideally mixed\nnonet, theta = arctan(1/sqrt{2}), this formula reduces to 2m_0^2 + 3m_1^2 =\n4m_{1/2}^2 + m_{0'}^2 which holds with an accuracy of ~1% for vector and tensor\nmesons. For pseudoscalar mesons, with the eta-eta' mixing angle\n-arctan[1/(2sqrt{2})] ~ -19.5^o, in agreement with experiment, it leads to the\nrelation 4m_K^2 = 3m_pi^2 + m_{eta'}^2 which holds to an accuracy of better\nthan 1% for the measured pseudoscalar meson masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 1997 20:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
