Theoretical models developed to explain early pulsar timing data can\nexplain spin down torques via a disk-magnetosphere interaction if the star\nnearly corotates with the inner accretion disk. To produce the observed BATSE\ntorque reversals, however, these equilibrium models require the disk to\nalternate between two mass accretion rates, with $\\dot M_{\\pm}$ producing\naccretion torques of similar magnitude, but always of opposite sign.

Very high\nnucleation rates and densities (10^8-10^{10} cm^{-2}) were obtained under 1\ntorr, which were 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than the counterpart (10^7\ncm^{-2}) under conventionally low pressure (tens of torr). The effects of\nsubstrate temperature and methane concentration under very low pressure were\nalso investigated, revealing that, overly high substrate temperature leads to a\nrelatively low nucleation density, and that higher CH_4 concentration gives\nrise to a higher density and a higher rate. The nucleation mechanism is\ndiscussed in detail. While a large amount of atomic hydrogen creates nucleating\nsites, sufficient supersaturation of carbon and/or hydrocarbon species on/near\nthe substrate surface is the key factor for nucleation, in competition against\nthe rapid formation of carbide. Very low pressure leads to long mean free path\nand other benefiting effects, and hence, is critical for rapid, high-density\nnucleation. Effects of substrate temperature and CH_4 concentration are also\nimportant. This further implies that C_2H_x (x<6) and CH_4 also contribute to\nnucleation, but CH_{1-3} dominates under very low pressure. The\nvery-low-pressure method seems to be the only candidate to make diamond\ndeposition on titanium films applicable.

For any starting positions, we\ncompute a determinant formula for the density function for the particles to be\nat specified positions at time $t$ without having collided by time $t$. We show\nthat the probability that there will be no collision up to time $t$ is\nasymptotic to a constant multiple of $t^{-n(n-1)/4}$ as $t$ goes to infinity,\nand compute the constant as a polynomial of the starting positions. We have\nanalogous results for the other classical Weyl groups; for example, the\nhyperoctahedral group $B_n$ gives a model of $n$ independent particles with a\nwall at $x=0$.\n  We can define Brownian motion on a Lie algebra, viewing it as a vector space;\nthe eigenvalues of a point in the Lie algebra correspond to a point in the Weyl\nchamber, giving a Brownian motion conditioned never to exit the chamber.
