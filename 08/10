Winds from nearby stars, located\napproximately 0.06 pc to the east of Sgr A*, should, in the absence of any\noutflow from the putative black hole itself, be accreting onto this object. We\nreport the results of the first 3D Bondi-Hoyle hydrodynamical numerical\nsimulations of this process under the assumption that the Galactic center wind\nis generated by several different point sources (here assumed to be 10\npseudo-randomly placed stars). Our results show that the accretion rate onto\nthe central object can be higher than in the case of a uniform flow since\nwind-wind shocks dissipate some of the bulk kinetic energy and lead to a higher\ncapture rate for the gas. However, even for this highly non-uniform medium,\nmost of the accreting gas carries with it a relatively low level of specific\nangular momentum, though large transient fluctuations can occur. Additionally,\nthe post-bow-shock focusing of the gas can be substantially different than that\nfor a uniform flow, but it depends strongly on the stellar spatial\ndistribution. We discuss how this affects the morphology of the gas in the\ninner 0.15 pc of the Galaxy and the consequences for accretion disk models of\nSgr A*.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Aug 1997 00:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The results of the\nequilibration are indeed affected by this choice. In particular, a variation of\n$\\a_s$ from 0.3 to 0.5 reduces the parton phase of the plasma by as much as 4.0\nfm/c and increasing coupling causes a reduction in the generated entropy. As\nfar as equilibration is concerned, larger coupling results in faster\nequilibration both chemically and kinetically but improvements only happen to\nthe fermions. These are accompanied by more rapid cooling and therefore\nshortened lifetime. In the light of these results, to choose $\\a_s$ is almost\nequivalent to choosing the results. Also because of consistency, any fixed\n$\\a_s$ is incompatible with an evolving plasma. The best choice is therefore\nnot to choose at all but let the system makes its own decision. We show a\nsimple recipe how this can be done. With an evolving coupling, equilibration is\naccelerated with better results at the expense of the duration of the\ndeconfined phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 1997 16:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
