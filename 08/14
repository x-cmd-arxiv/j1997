The shocks are assumed to be due to a variety of galactic sources on a\nrange of scales. An analytic result for the kinematic vorticity generated by a\nshock passing through a radially-stratified two-dimensional isobaric model\ncloud is derived, assuming that the Mach number is not so large that the cloud\nis disrupted, and neglecting the shock curvature and cloud distortion.\nTwo-dimensional lattic gas hydrodynamic simulations at modest Mach numbers were\nused to verify the analytic result. The induced internal velocities are\ninitially a significant fraction of the shock speed divided by the square root\nof the density contrast, accounting for both the observed linewidth amplitudes\nand the apparent cloud-to-cloud linewidth-density scaling. The linewidth-size\nrelation could then be interpreted in terms of the well-known power spectrum of\na system of shocks. The induced vortical energy should quickly be converted to\ncompressible and MHD modes, and so would be difficult to observe directly, even\nthough it would still be the power source for the other modes. The shockpump\nthus produces density structure without the necessity of any sort of\ninstability. We argue that the shockpump should lead to nested shock-induced\nstructures, providing a cascade mechanism for supersonic \"turbulence\" and a\nphysical explanation for the fractal-like structure of the cool interstellar\nmedium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 1997 21:12:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2000 19:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

We describe how the dynamics of the theory can be summarized in an\nequation of the Lax form, thereby demonstrating the existence of an infinite\nset of conserved quantities. Next, the $r$ matrix of a fundamental Poisson\nrelation is obtained and used to demonstrate that the conserved charges Poisson\ncommute. An underlying diffeomorphism symmetry of the equations of motion which\nis not a symmetry of the action is used to provide a geometric interpretation\nfor the case of gauge group SU(2). This enables us to show that the solutions\nto the classical equations of motion can be identified with a large class of\ncurves, to demonstrate an auto-B\\\"acklund transformation and to demonstrate a\nnon linear superposition principle. A link between the spectral problem for\n$QCD_{2}$ and the solution to the closed curve problem is also demonstrated. We\nthen go on to provide a systematic inverse scattering treatment. This formalism\nis used to obtain the reflectionless single boundstate eigenvalue soliton\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 1997 14:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Specializing to pipe and channel flows, we show that the mean\nmomentum balance in the neighborhood of $y_p^+$ is distinct in character from\nthose in the classical inner and outer layers. We revisit empirical data to\nconfirm that $y_p^+ = O(R^{1/2})$ and show that, in a neighborhood of order\n$R^{1/2}$ around $y_p^+$, only the viscous effects balance pressure-gradient\nterms. Here, R is the Reynolds number based on friction velocity and pipe\nradius (or channel half-width). This observation provides a mechanism by which\nviscous effects play an important role in regions traditionally thought to be\ninviscid or inertial; in particular, it throws doubt on the validity of the\nclassical matching principle. Even so, it is shown that the classical\nsemi-logarithmic behavior for the mean velocity distribution can be a useful\napproximation. It is argued that the recently advanced power-law profiles\npossess a rich underlying structure, and could be good approximations to the\ndata over an extended region (but they too are unlikely to be exact).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 1997 22:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
