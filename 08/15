Such a field structure could explain the\npolarization properties of some jets, and contribute to their lateral\nconfinement. A toroidal field geometry is also central to models for the Crab\nNebula - the archetypal plerion - and leads to the deduction that the Crab\npulsar's wind must have a weak magnetic field. Yet this `Z-pinch' field\nconfiguration is well known to be locally unstable, even when the magnetic\nfield is weak and/or boundary conditions slow or suppress global modes. Thus,\nthe magnetic field structures imputed to the interiors of jets and plerions are\nunlikely to persist.\n  To demonstrate this, I present a local analysis of Z-pinch instabilities for\nrelativistic fluids in the ideal MHD limit. Kink instabilities dominate,\ndestroying the concentric field structure and probably driving the system\ntoward a more chaotic state in which the mean field strength is independent of\nradius (and in which resistive dissipation of the field may be enhanced).

This is\na novel scenario for the blowout bifurcation and causes us to introduce the\nidea of set supercriticality to recognise such bifurcations.

In this talk I describe new probes of phenomena that are generic\nin models beyond the minimal framework. These include tests of supersymmetric\nflavor and CP violation and probes of kinematically inaccessible superparticle\nsectors through ``super-oblique corrections.'' Such probes have wide\napplicability to distinguishing models, from gravity- and gauge-mediated\ntheories to hybrid models and models with flavor symmetries.
