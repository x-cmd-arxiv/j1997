In this paper\nwe give several characterizations of good determinantal schemes. In particular,\nit is shown that being a good determinantal scheme of codimension $r+1$ is\nequivalent to being the zero-locus of a regular section of the dual of a first\nBuchsbaum-Rim sheaf of rank $r+1$. It is also equivalent to being standard\ndeterminantal and locally a complete intersection outside a subscheme $Y\n\\subset X$ of codimension $r+2$. Furthermore, for any good determinantal\nsubscheme $X$ of codimension $r+1$ there is a good determinantal subscheme $S$\ncodimension $r$ such that $X$ sits in $S$ in a nice way. This leads to several\ngeneralizations of a theorem of Kreuzer.

We consider the\neffect of such perturbations on the growth of adiabatic energy density\nperturbations in a cold dark matter component. We study two types of model, one\nbased on an exponential potential for the scalar field and the other on a\npseudo-Nambu Goldstone boson.

It\nis shown that the membrane creation is closely related to the degrees of\nfreedom in the off-diagonal blocks which are related via dualities to the\nchiral fermionic zero mode on a 0-8 string. In the dual system of a D0-brane\nand a D8-brane in type \\IIA theory the half-integral charges associated with\nthe ``half''-strings are found to be connected to the well-known fermion-number\nfractionalization in the presence of a fermionic zero mode. At sufficiently\nshort distances, the effective potential between the two five-branes is\ndominated by the zero mode contribution to the vacuum energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 1997 18:34:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 1997 20:15:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 1997 17:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
