A twisted inner disk may lead to high extinction towards stars often\nviewed through their disks. After the disk at all radii becomes optically thin,\nthe warp decays gradually on the local viscous timescale, which is likely to be\nlong.

A logatropic\nbehavior would require that $\\sigma \\propto \\rho^{-1/2}$, a result which,\nhowever, is not verified in the simulations. Instead, the velocity dispersion\nincreases with density, implying a polytropic behavior of $P_t$. This behavior\nis found both in purely hydrodynamic as well as hydromagnetic runs.

This\nhappens because the coupling to matter of superlight gravitinos is dominated by\nits goldstino component, whose coupling to matter is inversely proportional to\nthe scale of supersymmetry breaking and increases as the gravitino mass\ndecreases. Present observations therefore provide lower limits on the gravitino\nmass. Using recently revised goldstino couplings, we find that the two dominant\nprocesses in supernova cooling are $e^+e^-\\to \\tilde{G}\\tilde{G}$ and\n$\\gamma+e^-\\to e^-\\tilde{G}\\tilde{G}$. They lead to lower limits on the\nsupersymmetry breaking scale $\\Lambda_{S}$ from 160 to 500 GeV for core\ntemperatures 30 to 60 MeV and electron chemical potentials 200 to 300 MeV. The\ncorresponding lower limits on the gravitino mass are $.6 - 6\\times 10^{-6}$ eV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 1997 16:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
