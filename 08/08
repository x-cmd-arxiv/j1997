The parallel code is based upon the public-domain serial Adaptive\nP^3M code of Couchman et al(1). The algorithm resolves gravitational forces\ninto a long range component computed by discretizing the mass distribution and\nsolving Poisson's equation on a grid using an FFT convolution method, and a\nshort range component computed by direct force summation for sufficiently close\nparticle pairs. The code consists primarily of a particle-particle computation\nparallelized by domain decomposition over blocks of neighbor-cells, a more\nregular mesh calculation distributed in planes along one dimension, and several\ntransformations between the two distributions. Great care was taken throughout\nto make optimal use of the available memory, so that the current implementation\nis capable of simulating systems approaching 10^9 particles using a 1024^3 mesh\nfor the long range force computation. These are thus among the largest N-body\nsimulations ever carried out. We discuss these memory optimizations as well as\nthose motivated by computational performance.
