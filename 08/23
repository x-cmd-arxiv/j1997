Two-dimensional\nclusters and 2-leg ladders with up to 32 sites are studied with the Lanczos and\nTruncated Lanczos algorithms. The main motivation is the recently discussed\nspatial distribution of holes in ladders where the maximum probability for the\nhole-hole distance is obtained at d=sqrt(2) in units of the lattice spacing, a\ncounter-intuitive result considering that the overall symmetry of the two-hole\nbound state is d_{x^2 - y^2}. The existence of holes in the same sublattice is\nargued to be a consequence of non-negligible retardation effects in the t-J\nmodel. The existence of strong spin singlets in the region where the two hole\nbound state is located is here confirmed, and a simple explanation for its\norigin in the case of planes is proposed. It is predicted that they should\nappear regardless of the long distance properties of the spin system under\nconsideration, as long as the bound state is d_{x^2 - y^2}. In particular, it\nis shown that they are present in an Ising spin background. The time\nretardation in the family of t-J models leads naturally to low-energy hole\nstates with nonzero momentum and spin one, providing a possible explanation for\napparent SO(5)-symmetric features observed recently in this context. Finally,\nthe influence of a short-range Coulombic repulsion is analyzed. The hole\ndistribution in the d_{x^2 - y^2} bound state is reanalyzed in the presence of\nsuch repulsion.
