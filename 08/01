To illustrate this effect, two\nsituations are examined: one on the context of pregalactic conditions, and the\nother on the context of the actual interstellar medium. We focus our attention\non flash-like variations; that is, during a ``short'' period of time the\nionizing flux is enhanced in comparison to the pre- and post-flash values. In\nboth cases the cause of the induced phase change is the same: the enhancement\nof the cooling rate by the increase in the electron density caused by the\nmomentary increase of ionizing flux. After the passing of the flash, the\ncooling rate remains enhanced due to the ``inertia of the ionization''. In the\nfirst case (metal free gas) the cooling rate is enhanced due to the fact that\nthe increase of the electron density makes possible the gas phase formation of\nH_2 by the creation of the intermediaries H^- and H^+_2. We show that after the\npassing of the photo-ionizing flash a cloud near thermo-chemical equilibrium at\n~8000 K may be induced to increase its H_2 content by many orders of magnitude,\ncausing a rapid decrease of its temperature to values as low as 100 K. In the\nsecond case (solar abundances gas) the dominant cooling mechanism of the warm\nneutral gas (the excitation of heavy ions by electron impacts) is proportional\nto the electron density. We show that, for the expected states of the warm\ninterstellar gas, ionizing flashes may induce the phase transition from the\nwarm to the cool phase. The results indicate that the mechanism of induced\ncondensation studied here might play a relevant role in the gas evolution of\nthe diffuse gas in both, the pregalactic and the actual interstellar medium\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 1997 19:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For one dimensional periodicity (stripes), band gaps for\nwavevectors in the direction of periodicity are found corresponding to multiple\nBragg scattering. The dependence of these band gaps as a function of scatterer\ndensity, strength, and water depth is analyzed. We find in contrast to band gap\nbehavior in electronic, photonic, and acoustic systems, these gaps can increase\nwith excitation frequency $\\omega$. Thus, higher order Bragg scattering can\nplay a dominant role in suppressing wave propagation. Furthermore, in one\ndimension, an additional constraint (in addition to single scatterer energy and\nmomentum conservation) on the calculation of transmission $T$ and reflection\n$R$ coefficients of a finite number of scatterers is calculated from the exact\ndispersion relation of the infinite periodic system. This relationship may be\nuseful in measurements where only phase or amplitude is easily measured. In\nsimple two dimensional periodic geometries, we find no complete band gaps and\noffer semi-quantitative reasons for why this is so.

The mechanism\nrequires the existence of two (or more) baryon number carrying scalar fields\nwith masses and CP violating mixing which vary with the Higgs field expectation\nvalue. This mechanism can be implemented using squarks in supersymmetric\ntheories or using leptoquarks. Our central observation is that reflection of\nthese scalars from a bubble wall can yield a significant net baryon number flux\ninto the symmetric phase, balanced by a flux of opposite sign into the broken\nphase. For generic parameter choices, scalars with incident energies in a\nspecific, but not narrow, range yield order one reflection asymmetries (between\nthe probability of reflection of the scalars and of their antiparticles). The\ninteresting energies are those for which there are two propagating scalars in\nthe symmetric phase but only one in the broken phase. Electroweak sphaleron\nprocesses drive the baryon number in the symmetric phase toward zero, but do\nnot act in the broken phase.
