By connecting the corresponding Schr\\\"odinger equation with\nthe Laplace equation on the hyperboloid and the Schr\\\"odinger equation for the\nP\\\"oschl-Teller potential, we explain the exact solvability of the problem by\nan $so(2,2)$ symmetry algebra, and obtain an explicit realization of the latter\nas $su(1,1) \\oplus su(1,1)$. We prove that some of the $so(2,2)$ generators\nconnect among themselves wave functions belonging to different GMP's (called\nsatellite potentials). The conserved quantity is some combination of the\npotential parameters instead of the level energy, as for potential algebras.\nHence, $so(2,2)$ belongs to a new class of symmetry algebras. We also stress\nthe usefulness of our algebraic results for simplifying the calculation of\nFrank-Condon factors for electromagnetic transitions between rovibrational\nlevels based on different electronic states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 1997 15:35:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 1997 15:45:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
