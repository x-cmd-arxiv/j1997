By means of this\nrepresentation, we clarify the internal relation between the fourth Painlev\\'e\nequation and the modified KP hierarchy. We obtain in particular a complete\ndescription of the rational solutions of the fourth Painlev\\'e equation in\nterms of Schur functions. This implies that the so-called Okamoto polynomials,\nwhich arise from the $\\tau$-functions for rational solutions, are in fact\nexpressible by the 3-reduced Schur functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 1997 11:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
