The currently popular models\ninclude (1)the merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole\nbinary and (2)the hypernova scenario of the collapse of a massive member in a\nclose binary. Since a neutron star will inevitably collapse into a black hole\nif its mass exceeds the limit $M_{max}\\approx3M_{\\odot}$, releasing a total\nbinding gravitational energy of $\\sim10^{54}$ erg, we explore semi-empirically\nthe possibility of attributing the energy source of GRB to the accretion-\ninduced collapse of a neutron star (AICNS) in a massive X-ray binary system\nconsisting of a neutron star and a type O/B companion. This happens because a\nsignificant mass flow of $\\sim10^{-3}$--$10^{-4}M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ may be\ntransferred onto the neutron star through the Roche-lobe overflow and primarily\nduring the spiral-in phase when it plunges into the envelope of the companion,\nwhich may eventually lead to the AICNS before the neutron star merges with the\ncore of the companion. In this scenario, a ``dirty'' fireball with a moderate\namount of beaming is naturally expected because of the nonuniformity of the\nstellar matter surrounding the explosion inside the companion, and a small\nfraction ($\\sim0.1%$) of the energy is sufficient to create the observed GRBs.\nIn addition, the bulk of the ejecting matter of the companion star with a\nrelatively slow expansion rate may act as the afterglow. Assuming a\nnon-evolutionary model for galaxies, we estimate that the birthrate of the\nAICNS events is about 2 per day within a volume to redshift $z=1$ for an\n$\\Omega_0=1$ universe, consistent with the reported GRB rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 1997 11:51:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 1997 10:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The dynamics of GAs tend to be complicated and problem-specific.\nHowever, their empirical success warrants their further study. In this paper,\nguidelines for the design of genetic algorithms for protein structure\nprediction are determined. To accomplish this, the performance of the simplest\ngenetic algorithm is investigated for simple lattice-based protein structure\nprediction models (which is extendible to real-space), using energy\nminimization. The study has led us to two important conclusions for\n`protein-structure-prediction-genetic-algorithms'. Firstly, they require high\nresolution building blocks attainable by multi-point crossovers and secondly\nthey require a local dynamics operator to `fine tune' good conformations.\nFurthermore, we introduce a statistical mechanical approach to analyse the\ngenetic algorithm dynamics and suggest a convergence criterion using a quantity\nanalogous to the free energy of population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 1997 10:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
