These objects are very blue with colors of -0.4 < (C-T1) < 0.6, and\ntheir magnitudes are in the range of 20.6 < T1 < 22.9 mag which corresponds to\nabsolute magnitudes of -10.6 < M(T1) < -8.3 mag for a distance modulus of\n(m-M)o = 31.2. These objects are grouped spatially in three regions: the\ncentral region of UGC 7636, the tidal tail region, and the HI cloud region. No\nsuch objects were found in the counter tail region. It is concluded that these\nobjects are probably young star clusters which formed < 0.1Gyr ago during the\ninteraction between UGC 7636 and NGC 4472. Surface photometry of UGC 7636 (r <\n83\") shows that there is a significant excess of blue light along the tidal\ntail region compared with other regions. The star clusters are bluer than the\nstellar light in the tidal tail region, indicating that these clusters might\nhave formed later than most stars in the tidal tail region which were formed\nlater than most stars in the main body of the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Aug 1997 13:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
