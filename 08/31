The localization region of the GRB790613 event is\nstudied in the B, V and R filters. B-V and V-R colors of 196 objects with a S/N\n> 4 are measured up to the average practical photometric limit B < 25.7, V <\n25.7 and R < 25.6 for the whole obtained mosaic of CCD images. No blue objects\nwith B-V < 0 and V-R <0 were found up to B \\approx 25.2, which can be\ninterpreted as the absence of a compact object with a temperature > 1.5 10^{5},\nK in this direction up to a distance \\approx 40, pc. A probable common upper\nlimit to the temperature of the supposed compact objects in the vicinity of the\nSun is indicated based on the accumulated optical and X--ray data. The study of\nblue (B-V < 0) objects in the smallest (in the northern sky) gamma-ray box\nGRB790613, in view of the results of the search for point-like sources in the\nsoft X--ray in the localization regions of bright gamma-ray bursts, does not\nexclude the existence of such ``cold'' (<= 10^{5} K) objects, which could give\nan essential contribution to the observed density of hidden matter close to the\nSun and some of them could be related with the closest sources of gamma-ray\nbursts. Several interesting objects were also found in (or near) the\nlocalization region of the GRB790613 event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Aug 1997 16:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
