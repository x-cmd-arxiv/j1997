We are especially interested in the case where the spectrum of,\nsay, A_1 is partly or totally embedded into the continuous spectrum of A_0 and\nthe transfer function M_1(z)=A_1-z+V_1(z), where\nV_1(z)=B_{10}(z-A_0)^{-1}B_{01}, admits analytic continuation (as an\noperator-valued function) through the cuts along branches of the continuous\nspectrum of the entry A_0 into the unphysical sheet(s) of the spectral\nparameter plane. The values of z in the unphysical sheets where M_1^{-1}(z) and\nconsequently the resolvent (H-z)^{-1} have poles are usually called resonances.\nA main goal of the present work is to find non-selfadjoint operators whose\nspectra include the resonances as well as to study the completeness and basis\nproperties of the resonance eigenvectors of M_1(z) in {\\cal H}_1. To this end\nwe first construct an operator-valued function V_1(Y) on the space of operators\nin {\\cal H}_1 possessing the property: V_1(Y)\\psi_1=V_1(z)\\psi_1 for any\neigenvector \\psi_1 of Y corresponding to an eigenvalue z and then study the\nequation H_1=A_1+V_1(H_1). We prove the solvability of this equation even in\nthe case where the spectra of A_0 and A_1 overlap. Using the fact that the root\nvectors of the solutions H_1 are at the same time such vectors for M_1(z), we\nprove completeness and even basis properties for the root vectors (including\nthose for the resonances).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 1997 21:42:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 1997 20:25:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 1998 20:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Here the physical consequences of the stratification are\nexplored in the case where the gauge group SU(3) is broken to U(2). The\ndescription due to A.
