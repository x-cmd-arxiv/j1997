We monotonically map the QSO spectrum to a\nGaussian density field, measure its 3-d P(k), and normalize by evolving\ncosmological simulations with this P(k) until they reproduce the observed power\nspectrum of the QSO flux. Imposing the observed mean \\lya opacity as a\nconstraint makes the derived P(k) normalization insensitive to the choice of\ncosmological parameters, ionizing background spectrum, or reionization history.\nThus, in contrast to estimates of P(k) from galaxy clustering, there are no\nuncertain \"bias parameters\" in the recovery of the mass power spectrum. We test\nthe full procedure on SPH simulations of 3 cosmological models and show that it\nrecovers their true mass power spectra on comoving scales ~1-10/h Mpc, the\nupper scale being set by the size of the simulation boxes.

If an\ninitial f(t=0) is sufficiently close to some linearly stable lower energy f_0,\nits evolution involves linear phase space oscillations about f_0 which, in many\ncases, would be expected to exhibit linear Landau damping.

Transference methods afford a unified approach to\nmany problems in diverse areas, which before were proved by a variety of\nmethods. The purpose of this paper is to bring about a similar approach to the\nstudy of measures. Specifically, deep results in classical harmonic analysis\nand ergodic theory, due to Bochner, de Leeuw-Glicksberg, Forelli, and others,\nare all extensions of the classical F.&M. Riesz Theorem. We will show that all\nthese extensions are obtainable via our new transference principle for spaces\nof measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 1997 00:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 1999 20:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

It is shown that singular perturbation problems such as\nmultiple-scale and boundary layer problems can be treated more easily on a\ndifferential geometric basis. A general method is proposed based on\ndifferential forms and Lie-derivatives. Examples from multiple scale theory,\nboundary layer theory and WKB-theory are given and it is demonstrated that\nwithout the a priori knowledge of the scaling behaviour of the problem the\ncorrect asymptotic expansion can be derived with the aid of differential forms.\nThe method is well suited for a mechanical implementation in computer algebra\nprograms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 1997 10:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-06"}
