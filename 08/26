The\nglobal spectrophotometric properties of field galaxies can be well fit by a\nsimple stellar evolution model, defined by a time-dependent star formation rate\n(SFR) per unit comoving volume and a universal IMF extending from 0.1 to 125\nM_sun. In the best-fit models, the global SFR rises sharply, by about an order\nof magnitude, from a redshift of zero to a peak value at z~1.5, to fall again\nat higher redshifts. The models are able to account for the entire background\nlight recorded in the galaxy counts down to the very faint magnitude levels\nprobed by the HDF. Since only 20% of the current stellar content of galaxies is\nproduced at z>2, a rather low cosmic metallicity is expected at these early\ntimes, in good agreement with the observed enrichment history of the damped\nLyman-\\alpha systems. A ``monolithic collapse'' model, where half of the\npresent-day stars formed at z>2.5 and were shrouded by dust, can be made\nconsistent with the global history of light, but overpredicts the metal mass\ndensity at high redshifts as sampled by QSO absorbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 1997 21:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

A parametrization invariant formulation is\nobtained by introducing time and energy operators for the relativistic particle\nand then treating the Klein-Gordon equation as a constraint. The standard,\nphysical Hilbert space is recovered, via integration over proper time, from an\naugmented Hilbert space wherein time and energy are dynamical variables. It is\nshown that the Newton-Wigner position operator, being in this description a\nconstant of motion, acts on states in the augmented space. States with strictly\npositive energy are non-local in time; consequently, position measurements\nreceive contributions from states representing the particle's position at many\ntimes. Apparent superluminal propagation is explained by noting that, as the\nparticle is potentially in the past (or future) of the assumed initial place\nand time of localization, it has time to propagate to distant regions without\nexceeding the speed of light. An inequality is proven showing the Hegerfeldt\nparadox to be completely accounted for by the hypotheses of subluminal\npropagation from a set of initial space-time points determined by the quantum\ntime distribution arising from the positivity of the system's energy. Spatial\nlocalization can nevertheless occur through quantum interference between states\nrepresenting the particle at different times.
