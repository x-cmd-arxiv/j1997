Secondly, noting that there do not exist\nany direct measurements for the tau-lepton electric dipole moment (EDM), we\naddress the importance of performing its direct measurements at $e^+e^-$\ncollisions off the Z-boson pole at TRISTAN, LEPII and CLEOII. We present a\nrough comparison of the potential of these experiments in the $\\tau$ EDM\nmeasurements. Finally, we report on our recent works for probing CP violation\nin the semileptonic decays of the tau lepton, which involve two different\nintermediate resonances with large ratios of widths to masses, and which can be\nmost efficiently identified at the planned $B$ and proposed $\\tau$-charm\nfactories. All the CP-violation phenomena in the processes under consideration,\nif discovered, imply new CP-violation mechanisms completely different from the\nStandard Model CP violation mechanism through the complex phase of the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 1997 09:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here we investigate theoretically and numerically the effect of\nrepeated measurements on the quantum dynamics of the multilevel systems that\nexhibit the quantum localization of the classical chaos. The analysis is based\non the wave function and Schroedinger equation, without introduction of the\ndensity matrix. We show how the quantum Zeno effect in simple few-level systems\ncan be recovered and understood by formal modeling the measurement effect on\nthe dynamics by randomizing the phases of the measured states. Further the\nsimilar analysis is extended to investigate of the dynamics of multilevel\nsystems driven by an intense external force and affected by frequent\nmeasurement. We show that frequent measurements of such quantum systems results\nin the delocalization of the quantum suppression of the classical chaos. This\nresult is the opposite of the quantum Zeno effect. The phenomenon of\ndelocalization of the quantum suppression and restoration of the classical-like\ntime evolution of these quasiclassical systems, owing to repetitive frequent\nmeasurements, can therefore be called the 'quantum anti-Zeno effect'. From this\nanalysis we furthermore conclude that frequently or continuously observable\nquasiclassical systems evolve basically in a classical manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 1997 15:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}
