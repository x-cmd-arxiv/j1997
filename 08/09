This talk summarizes recent work which unifies these two sets of\nconformal field theories, together with a presumable large class of new\nconformal field theories. The basic idea is to consider spin-two operators of\nthe form $L_{ij} \\partial x^i \\partial x^j$ in the background of a general\nsigma model. The requirement that these operators satisfy the Virasoro algebra\nleads to a set of equations called the unified Einstein-Virasoro master\nequation, in which the spin-two spacetime field $L_{ij}$ couples to the usual\nspacetime fields of the sigma model. The one-loop form of this unified system\nis presented, and some of its algebraic and geometric properties are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 1997 21:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In contrast the corresponding partial wave\ncontributions, whose number increases with increasing energy, become more and\nmore oscillatory with increasing energy. The angular and momentum dependence of\nthe full amplitude is studied and displayed on as well as off the energy shell\nas function of positive and negative energies. The behavior of the t-matrix in\nthe vicinity of bound state poles and resonance poles in the second energy\nsheet is studied. It is found that the angular dependence of T exhibits a very\ncharacteristic behavior in the vicinity of those poles, which is given by the\nLegendre function corresponding to the quantum number either of the bound state\nor the resonance (or virtual) state.
