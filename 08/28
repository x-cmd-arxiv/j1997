The error in this\ncase is dominated by the photometric cosmic scatter in using BCG as distance\nestimators.

We examine the spectral index\nby using both analytical and numerical methods for a variety of physical\nparameters as such the plasma temperature and the mass accretion rate. The\npresence of the event horizon as well as the behaviour of the null geodesics in\nits vicinity largely determine the dependence of the spectral index on the flow\nparameters. We come to the conclusion that the bulk motion of a converging flow\nis more efficient in upscattering photons than thermal Comptonization provided\nthat the electron temperature in the flow is of order of a few keV or less. In\nthis case, the spectrum observed at infinity consists of a soft component\nproduced by those input photons that escape after a few scatterings without any\nsignificant energy change and of hard component (described by a power law)\nproduced by the photons that underwent significant upscattering. The luminosity\nof the power-law component is relatively small compared to that of the soft\ncomponent. For accretion into black hole the spectral energy index of the\npower-law is always higher than one for plasma temperature of order of a few\nkeV.
