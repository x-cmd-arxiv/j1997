Rather than employing EBL for specializing parsers by\ninferring new ones, this paper suggests employing EBL for learning how to\nreduce ambiguity only partially.\n  The present method consists of an EBL algorithm for learning partial-parsers,\nand a parsing algorithm which combines partial-parsers with existing\n``full-parsers\". The learned partial-parsers, implementable as Cascades of\nFinite State Transducers (CFSTs), recognize and combine constituents\nefficiently, prohibiting spurious overgeneration. The parsing algorithm\ncombines a learned partial-parser with a given full-parser such that the role\nof the full-parser is limited to combining the constituents, recognized by the\npartial-parser, and to recognizing unrecognized portions of the input sentence.\nBesides the reduction of the parse-space prior to disambiguation, the present\nmethod provides a way for refining existing disambiguation models that learn\nstochastic grammars from tree-banks.\n  We exhibit encouraging empirical results using a pilot implementation:\nparse-space is reduced substantially with minimal loss of coverage. The speedup\ngain for disambiguation models is exemplified by experiments with the DOP\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 1997 09:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
