The interaction between the stellar winds from the SN\nprogenitor is considered to be the candidate for the formation of the\ncircumstellar structure. In the case that the stellar winds are spherically\nsymmetric, the interaction should result in a shell-like structure. However, in\nthis paper we show that the magnetic field in the winds causes an anisotropy\nwhich leads to the formation of a ring-like structure. When the fast wind of\nthe blue supergiant phase of the progenitor sweeps up the surrounding slow wind\nof the red-supergiant phase, the magnetic field as well as the wind material\nare piled up in the interaction region. Since the magnetic energy increases in\nproportion to the square of the amplitude, the magnetic field exhibits its\neffect prominently at the interaction region; due to the magnetic pressure\nforce the material at lower latitudes is compressed into a ring-like structure.\nIt is suggested that this magnetic process can also explain the newly observed\npair of rings of the SN 1987A nebula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 1997 16:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Since the KH instability in\nsupersonic jets involves acoustic waves over-reflected on jet boundaries, the\nbasic nonlinear effect relies on the steepening of the acoustic wave fronts,\nleading to the formation of shocks. It turns our that the shocks appear\npredominantly in the external nonrelativistic gas, while the internal acoustic\nwaves remain linear for a much longer time. In addition, the external medium\n\"hardens\" as soon as the boundary oscillation velocity becomes comparable to\nthe external sound speed. On the other hand, the amplification of internal\nwaves due to the over-reflection is limited by a nonlinearity of the Lorentz\n$\\gamma$ factor.
