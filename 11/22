Second, we find\nthat in the overdoped materials the gap Delta at all k-points on the Fermi\nsurface has significant temperature dependence and vanishes near Tc. In\ncontrast, in the underdoped samples such behavior is found only at k-points\nclose to the diagonal. Near (pi,0), Delta is essentially T-independent in the\nunderdoped samples. The filling-in of the pseudogap with increasing T is\ndescribed by a broadening proportional to T-Tc, which is naturally explained by\npairing correlations above Tc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 1997 23:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We elucidate the\nmechanism behind such instabilities by considering minimally coupled, massless,\nscalar, test quantum fields on general two dimensional spacetimes with Cauchy\nhorizons which are classically stable. We identify a geometric feature of such\nspacetimes which is a necessary condition for obtaining a quantum mechanical\ndivergence of the renormalized expected stress tensor on the Cauchy horizon for\nregular initial states. This feature is the divergence of the affine parameter\nlength of a one parameter family of null geodesics which lie parallel to the\nCauchy horizon, where the affine parameter normalization is determined by\nparallel transport along a fixed, transverse null geodesic which intersects the\nCauchy horizon. (By contrast, the geometric feature of such spacetimes which\nunderlies classical blueshift instabilities is the divergence of a holonomy\noperator). We show that the instability can be understood as a ``delayed\nblueshift'' instability, which arises from the infinite blueshifting of an\nenergy flux which is created locally and quantum mechanically. The instability\nmechanism applies both to chronology horizons in spacetimes with closed\ntimelike curves, and to the inner horizon in black hole spacetimes like two\ndimensional Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 1997 20:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In\nparticular, our result gives an easy proof that inseparabitity (or\nentanglement) is a pure quantum (noncommutative) notion. This implies that\ndistinction between separability and inseparabitity has sense only for\ncomposite systems consisting of pure quantum subsystems. Moreover, we provide\nthe unified characterization of pure-state entanglement and mixed-state\nentanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 1997 16:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

I point out that the reasoning leading to\nthis conclusion relies on an essential ambiguity regarding the meaning of the\nexpression ``statement that refers only to phenomena confined to an earlier\ntime'' when such a statement contains counterfactual conditionals. As a result\nthe argumentation does not justify the conclusion that there can be frames of\nreference in which future choices can affect present facts. But it does provide\nan instructive and interestingly different opportunity to illustrate a central\npoint of Bohr's reply to Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 1997 21:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
