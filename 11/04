In view of this sensitivity, a recourse to detailed stellar models is\nmandatory. With the help of some simplifying assumptions concerning in\nparticular the third dredge-up characteristics, some of which (like its depth)\nbeing considered as free parameters, predictions are made for the 205Pb\ncontamination of the stellar surface at the end of a pulse-interpulse cycle\nfollowing a series of a dozen of pulses in three different intermediate-mass\nstars (M=3M_sun,Z=0.02; M=6M_sun,Z=0.02; M=3M_sun,Z=0.001). It is concluded\nthat the chances for a significant 205Pb surface enrichment are likely to\nincrease with M for a given Z, or to increase with decreasing Z for a given M.\nMore specifically, following the considered pulses at least, the enrichment\nappears to be rather unlikely in the 3M_sun star with Z=0.02, while it seems to\nbe much more probable in the other two considered stars. It is also speculated\nthat the (3M_sun,Z=0.02) star could possibly experience some 205Pb enrichment\nfollowing later pulses than the ones considered in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 1997 08:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The reason is\nthat the quantum tunneling responsible for the nucleation of the bubble does\nnot occur simultaneously along both field directions and equal-time\nhypersurfaces in the open universe are not synchronized with equal-density or\nfixed-field hypersurfaces. The most probable tunneling trajectory corresponds\nto a zero value of the inflaton field; large values, necessary for the second\nperiod of inflation inside the bubble, only arise as localized fluctuations.\nThe interior of each nucleated bubble will contain an infinite number of such\ninflating regions of comoving size of order $\\gamma^{-1}$, where $\\gamma$\ndepends on the parameters of the model. Each one of these islands will be a\nquasi-open universe. Since the volume of the hyperboloid is infinite, inflating\nislands with all possible values of the field at their center will be realized\ninside of a single bubble. We may happen to live in one of those patches of\ncomoving size $d\\lesssim \\gamma^{-1}$, where the universe appears to be open.\nIn particular, we consider the ``supernatural'' model proposed by Linde and\nMezhlumian. There, an approximate U(1) symmetry is broken by a tunneling field\nin a first order phase transition, and slow-roll inflation inside the nucleated\nbubble is driven by the pseudo-Goldstone field. We find that the excitations of\nthe pseudo-Goldstone produced by the nucleation and subsequent expansion of the\nbubble place severe constraints on this model.

The theoretical framework, based on the phase space\nslicing method and the use of universal crossing functions, is described in\ndetail. All analytical formulae necessary for the next-to-leading order\ncalculations are provided. The numerical results are based on the fully\ndifferential $ep \\to n$ jets event generator \\docuname which allows to analyze\nany infrared and collinear safe observable and general cuts in terms of parton\n4-momenta. The importance of higher order corrections is studied for various\njet algorithms. Implications and comparisons with (ongoing) experimental\nanalyses for jet cross sections at high $Q^2$, the determination of\n$\\alpha_s(\\mu_R)$, the gluon density, power corrections in event shapes and the\nassociated forward jet production in the low $x$ regime at HERA are discussed.\nA study of jet cross sections in polarized electron and polarized proton\ncollisions shows that dijet events provide a good measurement of the polarized\ngluon distribution $\\Delta g(x_g)$, in a region, where $x_g \\Delta g(x_g)$ is\nexpected to show a maximum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 1997 10:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
