The 8 GHz image reveals a linear triple\nstructure (~4'', 1.5 kpc) oriented perpendicular to the optical polarization\nposition angle.

This absorption is almost entirely blueshifted, indicating a fast net\noutflow, but a faint and narrow redshifted component is also present.

(Higher-order diagrams preserve this form of the\ninterparticle potential.) For sufficiently small atom mass, the lowest-energy\nstate is not the `empty' state with no atoms, but a state with a non-zero\ndensity of spontaneously created atoms, Bose-condensed in the zero-momentum\nmode.
