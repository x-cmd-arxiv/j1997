Indeed, the estimates one can obtain\nusing these critical-exponent norms appear to be the best possible when one\nneeds to bound the norm of a Green's operator for a Laplacian, depending on a\nconnection varying in a non-compact family, in terms of minimal data such as\nthe first positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian or the L^2 norm of the curvature\nof the connection. Following Taubes, we describe a collection of\ncritical-exponent Sobolev norms and general Green's operator estimates\ndepending only on first positive eigenvalues or the L^2 norm of the\nconnection's curvature. Such estimates are particularly useful in the gluing\nconstruction of solutions to non-linear partial differential equations\ndepending on a degenerating parameter, such as the approximate, reference\nsolution in the anti-self-dual or PU(2) monopole equations. We apply them here\nto prove an optimal slice theorem for the quotient space of connections. The\nresult is optimal in the sense that if a point [A] in the quotient space is\nknown to be just L^2_1-close enough to a reference point [A_0], then the\nconnection A can be placed in Coulomb gauge relative to the connection A_0,\nwith all constants depending at most on the first positive eigenvalue of the\ncovariant Laplacian defined by A_0 and the L^2 norm of the curvature of A_0. In\nthis paper we shall for simplicity only consider connections over\nfour-dimensional manifolds, but the methods and results can adapted to\nmanifolds of arbitrary dimension to prove slice theorems which apply when the\nreference connection is allowed to degenerate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 1997 14:13:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 1999 22:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-08"}

Moreover, this subset should be selected so as to guarantee\n(among other things) that we can dispense with the orthodox interpretation's\nloose talk about 'measurement values': \"...the probability of a beable being a\nparticular value would be calculated just as was formerly calculated the\nprobability of observing that value\". Working in the framework of C*-algebras\n(in particular, Segal algebras), I propose an algebraic characterization of\nthose subsets of bounded observables of a quantum system that can have beable\nstatus with respect to any (fixed) state of the system. It turns out that\nobservables with beable status in a state need not all commute (a possibility\nBell himself does not consider), but they must at least form a certain kind of\n'quasicommutative' subalgebra determined by the state. A virtue of the analysis\nis that it applies to beables with continuous spectra, usually neglected in\ndiscussions of the no-hidden-variables theorems. In the (very) special case\nwhere the algebra of observables for a system is representable on a\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert space, I give a complete characterization of the\nmaximal beable subalgebras determined by any state of the system; the\ninfinite-dimensional case remains open.
