We show that they agree perfectly with BPS\nformula provided suitable geometric interpretation of the junction is given. We\nprovide a precise statement of BPS limit and force-balance property. At weak\ncoupling and sufficiently dense limit, we argue that (p,q)-string embedded in\nstring network is a `wiggly string', whose low-energy dynamics can be described\nvia renormalization group evolved, smooth effective non-relativistic string. We\nalso suggest the possibility that, upon Type IIB strings are promoted to\nM-theory membrane, there can exist `evanescent' bound-states at triple junction\nin the continuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 1997 12:03:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 1997 03:29:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 1997 10:08:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 1997 06:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
