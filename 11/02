The newly\ndiscovered HH objects demonstrate a great variety of morphological structures,\nincluding 5 jets, 7 arcs, 12 cirri or cirrus groups, 13 patches, and many\nknots. These objects provide a new comprehensive database for the study of HH\nobjects in the regions of recent star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 1997 02:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The rapidity density of net\nprotons at midrapidity in central nucleus-nucleus collisions increases both\nwith target mass for sulphur projectiles and with the projectile mass for a\ngold target. The shape of the rapidity distributions of net protons forward of\nmidrapidity for d+Au and central S+Au collisions is similar. The average\nrapidity loss is larger than 2 units of rapidity for reactions with the gold\ntarget. The transverse momentum spectra of net protons for all reactions can be\ndescribed by a thermal distribution with `temperatures' between 145 +- 11 MeV\n(p+S interactions) and 244 +- 43 MeV (central S+Au collisions). The\nmultiplicity of negatively charged hadrons increases with the mass of the\ncolliding system. The shape of the transverse momentum spectra of negatively\ncharged hadrons changes from minimum bias p+p and p+S interactions to p+Au and\ncentral nucleus-nucleus collisions. The mean transverse momentum is almost\nconstant in the vicinity of midrapidity and shows little variation with the\ntarget and projectile masses. The average number of produced negatively charged\nhadrons per participant baryon increases slightly from p+p, p+A to central\nS+S,Ag collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Nov 1997 18:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We show that the boost has\nto be performed in the covering space and the boosted coordinate has to be\ncompactified on a circle with a Lorentz contracted radius. Using this fact we\nshow that the transition between Schwarzschild black holes to black p-branes\nobserved recently in M theory is the well-known black hole- black string\ntransition viewed in a boosted frame. In a similar way the correspondence point\nwhere an excited string state goes over to a neutral black hole is mapped\nexactly to the correspondence point for black p-branes. In terms of the $p$\nbrane quantities the equation of state for an excited string state becomes\nidentical to that of a 3+1 dimensional massless gas for all $p$. Finally, we\nshow how boosts can be used to relate Hawking radiation rates. Using the known\nmicroscopic derivation of absorption by extremal 3-branes and near-extremal 5D\nholes with three large charges we provide a microscopic derivation of\nabsorption of 0-branes by seven and five dimensional Schwarzschild black holes\nin a certain regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Nov 1997 22:59:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 1997 16:31:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}
