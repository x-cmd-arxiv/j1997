We study\nanalytically the spherically-symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-scalar equations\nasymptotically near the singularity. We obtain a series-expansion solution for\nthe metric functions and for the scalar field near $r=0$ under the simplifying\nassumption of homogeneity.

We find that there indeed exists a generic spacelike\nsingularity solution for these equations (in the sense that the solution\ndepends on enough free parameters), with similar properties to those found in\nthe numerical simulations. This singularity is strong in the Tipler sense,\nnamely, every extended object would inevitably be crushed to zero volume. In\nthis sense this is a similar singularity to the spacelike singularity inside\nuncharged spherical black holes. On the other hand, there are some important\ndifferences between the two cases.

The lowest\nstates of the $\\Pi$ manifold are studied for spin singlet and triplet$(M_s =\n-1) $ as well as gerade and ungerade parity for a broad range of field\nstrengths $0 \\leq B \\leq 100 a.u.$ For both states with gerade parity we\nobserve a monotonous decrease in the dissociation energy with increasing field\nstrength up to $B = 0.1 a.u.$ and metastable states with respect to the\ndissociation into two H atoms occur for a certain range of field strengths. For\nboth states with ungerade parity we observe a strong increase in the\ndissociation energy with increasing field strength above some critical field\nstrength $B_c$. As a major result we determine the transition field strengths\nfor the crossings among the lowest $^1\\Sigma_g$, $^3\\Sigma_u$ and $^3\\Pi_u$\nstates. The global ground state for $B \\lesssim 0.18 a.u.$ is the strongly\nbound $^1\\Sigma_g$ state. The crossings of the $^1\\Sigma_g$ with the\n$^3\\Sigma_u$ and $^3\\Pi_u$ state occur at $B \\approx 0.18$ and $B \\approx0.39\na.u.$, respectively.
