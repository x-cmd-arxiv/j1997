Using simple scaling laws for\nthe luminosity of the cold disk, the thermal dissipation/heating rate in the\ncorona, and the rate of energy injection from a non-thermal source, all as\nfunctions of radius of the corona, we explain the hard-to-soft transition as\nthe result of a decrease in the size of the corona and the inner radius of the\ncold disk by a factor ~ 5. For the case of Cyg X-1, we show that the bolometric\nluminosity of the source (mass accretion rate) does not change significantly\nduring the transition, and thus the transition is probably the result of a disk\ninstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 1997 17:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The intrinsic C\nIV absorption in the core of the broad emission line is resolved for the first\ntime into four distinct kinematic components, which are all blue-shifted\nrelative to the systemic radial velocity of the host galaxy.

All of the spectra were obtained when the broad emission line and\ncontinuum fluxes were at an historic low level, allowing us to accurately\ndetermine the contribution of the narrow-line region (NLR) to the emission\nlines. We have generated multicomponent photoionization models to investigate\nthe relative strength of the high ionization lines compared to those in Seyfert\n2 galaxies, and the weakness of the narrow Mg II 2800 line.

The very high ionization lines (N V, [Ne V], [Fe VII], [Fe X])\nare stronger than the predictions of our standard model, and we show that this\nmay be due to supersolar abundances and/or a ``blue bump'' in the extreme\nultraviolet (although recent observations do not support the latter). An outer\ncomponent of NLR gas (at only ~70 pc from the continuum source) is needed to\nproduce the low ionization lines. We show that the outer component may contain\ndust, which further reduces the Mg II flux by depletion and by absorption of\nthe resonance photons after multiple scatterings. We show that the majority of\nthe emission in the NLR of NGC 5548 must arise within about ~70 pc from the\nnucleus.

In particular we\nconsider a realistic situation where all orbits with instability up to a\ncertain cutoff are known.

Using density-functional theory and the\nfull-potential linear augmented plane-wave method, we investigate the potential\nenergy surface (PES) of the dissociative adsorption of H_2 on the sulfur\ncovered Pd(100) surface. The PES is changed significantly compared to the\ndissociation on the clean Pd(100) surface, in particular for hydrogen close to\nthe S atoms. While the hydrogen dissociation at the clean Pd(100) surface is\nnon-activated, for the (2x2) sulfur adlayer (coverage Theta_S= 0.25) the\ndissociation of H_2 is inhibited by energy barriers. Their heights strongly\ndepend on the distance between the hydrogen and sulfur atoms leading to a\nhighly corrugated PES. The largest barriers are in the vicinity of the sulfur\natoms due to the strong repulsion between sulfur and hydrogen. Still the\nhydrogen dissociation on the (2x2) sulfur covered Pd(100) surface is\nexothermic. Thus the poisoning effect of sulfur adatoms for H_2 dissociation at\nlow sulfur coverage (Theta_S <= 0.25) is mainly governed by the formation of\nenergy barriers, not by blocking of the adsorption sites. For the c(2x2) sulfur\nadlayer (Theta_S= 0.5), the PES for hydrogen dissociation is purely repulsive.\nThis is due to the fact that for all different possible adsorption geometries\nthe hydrogen molecules come too close to the sulfur adatoms before the\ndissociation is completed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 1997 12:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We\nhave shown that within the single-particle approximation of nuclear Hamiltonian\nthe TNDBD matrix element is equal to zero. The (renormalized) quasiboson\napproximation scheme imply for TNDBD transition operator to be a constant, if\none requires the equivalence of initial and final (renormalized) QRPA\nHamiltonians. It means that TNDBD is a higher order process in the boson\nexpansion of the nuclear Hamiltonian. We have found that the mismatching of\nboth Hamiltonians is getting worse with increasing strength of particle-\nparticle interaction especially in the case of QRPA Hamiltonians. It is\nsupposed to be one of the reasons of the extreme sensitivity of studied matrix\nelement to the residual interaction appearing in explicit calculations\ninvolving the intermediate nucleus. Further, the Operator Expansion Method\n(OEM) has been reconsidered and new transition operators have been rederived in\na consistent way. The validity of the OEM approximation has been discussed in\nrespect to the other approximation schemes. The OEM combined with QRPA or RQRPA\nground state wave functions reflects sensitively the instabilities incorporated\nin the considered ground states. Therefore, the predicting power of the OEM\nshould be studied with help of other ground state wave functions. e.g. shell\nmodel ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 1997 10:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-15"}
