We detected 13 point-like sources in this galaxy, 10 of which\nwere previously unknown. We measured extended X-ray radiation from almost the\nwhole optically visible galaxy. Comparing the diffuse soft and hard X-ray\nemission components, we observed a different asymmetric distribution and a\nslower radial decrease of the intensity profile of the soft X-ray emission.\nBoth these results support the existence of a huge spherical gas halo of 10-15\nkpc radius. On the other hand, the radial scale lengths of the hard X-ray\nradiation, that of the thermal radio emission and the profile of the optical\nsurface brightness are similar, favouring the idea that all these emission\nprocesses are connected to star formation in the galaxy's disk. M83 is the\nfirst face-on galaxy where the diffuse X-ray emission spectrum can be\ncharacterized by a two-temperature thermal plasma: a soft X-ray emitting warm\n`halo component' and an internally absorbed hot `disk component' which is\ndominating the emission in the hard (0.5-2.0 keV) ROSAT energy range. The\ncombination of X-ray and radio polarization observations allows an estimate of\nthe plasma parameter beta = U_therm/U_magn which is found to be 0.2+/-0.1. This\nresult supports the hypothesis that magnetic fields play an important role for\nthe evolution and structure of galactic gas haloes. The high energy input rate\nin the active star-forming disk of M83 seems to be responsible for the outflow\nof hot gas and the halo formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 1997 17:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
