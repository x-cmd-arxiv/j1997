(This conclusion might be avoided if\nthere are large radial velocity dispersions [>~1000 km/s] in the emitting\nregion and the resonant absorption of continuum photons enhances the flux in\nweaker lines.)

This theory, with 24\nsupercharges, reduces to the known N=6 supergravity after a toroidal\ncompactification to D=5 and D=4. Evidence for this theory was given long ago by\nB. Julia. We show that this theory suffers from a gravitational anomaly equal\nto 4/7 of the pure N=(4,0) supergravity anomaly. However, unlike the latter,\nthe absence of N=(4,2) matter to cancel the anomaly presumably makes this\ntheory inconsistent. We discuss the obstruction in defining this theory in D=6,\nstarting from an N=6 five-dimensional string model in the decompactification\nlimit. The set of massless states necessary for the anomaly cancellation\nappears in this limit; as a result the N=(4,2) supergravity in D=6 is extended\nto N=(4,4) maximal supergravity theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 1997 10:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

The characteristic Mixmaster evolution through a series of\nKasner epochs is studied in detail. In the Einstein frame an infinite sequence\nof chaotic oscillations of the scale factors on approach to the initial\nsingularity is impossible, as it was in general relativistic Mixmaster\nuniverses in the presence of a massless scalar field.\n  A finite sequence of oscillations of the scale factors described by\napproximate Kasner metrics is possible, but it always ceases when all expansion\nrates become positive. In the string frame the evolution through Kasner epochs\nchanges to a new form which reflects the duality symmetry of the theory. Again,\nwe show that chaotic oscillations must end after a finite time. The need for\nduality symmetry appears to be incompatible with the presence of chaotic\nbehaviour as $t \\to 0$.
