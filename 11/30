To study the\norigin of the optical -- ultraviolet variability in AGN, we compare light\ncurves of two models to observations of quasar 0957+561 in terms of a structure\nfunction analysis. In the starburst (SB) model, random superposition of\nsupernovae in the nuclear starburst region produce aperiodic luminosity\nvariations, while in the disk-instability (DI) model, variability is caused by\ninstabilities in the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole.

In addition, we examine the\ntime-asymmetry of the light curves by calculating $V(\\tau)$ separately for\nbrightening and decaying phases. The two models exhibit opposite trends of\ntime-asymmetry to some extent, although the present observation is not long\nenough to test this prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Nov 1997 15:07:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 1998 06:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

An elementary\nmodule is determined by a skew Young diagram and by a complex parameter, and\ncontains a vector called singular. We give sufficient conditions for cyclicity\nin $V$ of the tensor product of these singular vectors. By using this result,\nwe give an irreducibility criterion for $V$ when each of the skew Young\ndiagrams determining the tensor factors has rectangular shape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Nov 1997 13:30:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 11:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}
