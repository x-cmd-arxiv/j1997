The discrepancy may also arise from environmental effects\nsuch as the density-morphology relationship for which we see strong evidence in\nthe LCRS galaxies. However, the Schechter parameterization is more effective\nfor the luminosity functions of the individual spectral types. The data show a\nsignificant, progressive steepening of the faint-end slope, from alpha = +0.5\nfor early-type objects, to alpha = -1.8 for the extreme late-type galaxies.

It is examined how the pattern of soft terms changes when one\nmoves from the weakly coupled heterotic string limit to the M-theory limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 1997 14:38:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 1997 06:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The ground states of the Sigma manifold are studied for\nungerade and gerade parity as well as singlet and triplet states covering a\nbroad regime of field strengths from B = 0 up to B = 100a.u. A variety of\ninteresting phenomena can be observed. For the ^1Sigma_g state we found a\nmonotonous decrease of the equilibrium distance and a simultaneously increase\nof the dissociation energy with growing magnetic field strength. The ^3\\Sigma_g\nstate is shown to develop an additional minimum which has no counterpart in\nfield-free space. The ^1\\Sigma_u state shows a monotonous increase in the\ndissociation energy with first increasing and than decreasing internuclear\ndistance of the minimum. For this state the dissociation channel is H_2 to H^-\n+ H^+ for magnetic-field strengths B greater than 20a.u. due to the existence\nof strongly bound H^- states in strong magnetic fields.
