Coupling with supersymmetric point particles is obtained\nimplicitly by extending the DJH matching conditions of gravity. The consistent\nsolution of the interacting case is obtained by building a general non-trivial\nmapping, extending the superanalytic mapping, between a flat polydromic $X^M$\nsupercoordinate system and a physical one $x^N$, representing the DJH matching\nconditions around the superparticles. We show how to construct such a mapping\nin terms of analytic functions, and we give their exact expressions for the two\nbody case. The extension to the N body case is also discussed. In the\nMinkoskian coordinates the superparticles move freely, and in particular the\nfermionic coordinates $\\Theta(\\xi^N_{(i)})$ are constants, whose values can be\nfixed by using the monodromy properties. While the bosonic part of the\nsupergeodesic equations are obtained, as in gravity, by measuring the bosonic\ndistance in Minkowskian space-time, we find that the fermionic geodesic\nequations can be defined only by requiring that a non-perturbative divergence\nof the $X^M = X^M(x^N)$ mapping cancels out on the world-lines of the\nsuperparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 1997 15:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
