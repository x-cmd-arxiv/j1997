It replaces the detailed\nand lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous\nplanning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve\nperformance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance\nimprovements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem\nsimilarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning\neffort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP\ndepends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes\nthe design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner\nDERSNLP+EBL. DERSNLP+EBL extends current CBP methodology by incorporating\nexplanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from\nthe retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine\njudgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision\nhas been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library,\nthrough the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as\nsingle goal subproblems. Multi-goal problems are stored only when these smaller\ncases fail to be merged into a full solution. An empirical evaluation of this\napproach demonstrates the advantage of learning from experienced retrieval\nfailure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Nov 1997 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

In such a model the environment state\n(controlled by Nature) may change arbitrarily, and the feedback/reward function\nis initially unknown. The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a\nprior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his\nreward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action\nto every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are\nconsidered. In one of them -- the perfect monitoring case -- the agent is able\nto observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the\nother -- the imperfect monitoring case -- all that is available to the agent is\nthe reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable\nprocesses, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result\nrefers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We\nprove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the\ncompetitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high\nprobability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. It\nis further shown that such an optimal policy does not exist in the imperfect\nmonitoring case. Moreover, it is proved that in the perfect monitoring case\nthere does not exist a deterministic policy that satisfies our long run\noptimality criterion. In addition, we discuss the maxmin criterion and prove\nthat a deterministic efficient optimal strategy does exist in the imperfect\nmonitoring case under this criterion.
