In Type Ia supernovae, a departure in the bolometric light curve\nfrom the full-trapping decline of $^{56}$Co can occur within the two and a half\nyears after the explosion, depending on the evolutionary path followed by the\nWD during the accretion phase. If convection has developed in the WD core\nduring the presupernova evolution, starting several thousand years before the\nexplosion, a tangled magnetic field close to the equipartition value should\nhave grown in the WD. Such an intense magnetic field would confine positrons\nwhere they originate from the $^{56}$Co decays, and preclude a strong departure\nfrom the full-trapping decline, as the supernova expands. This situation is\nexpected to occur in C+O Chandrasekhar WDs as opposed to edge-lit detonated\nsub-Chandrasekhar WDs.

Magnetized jets subject to collisionally\nexcited radiative losses have not, as yet, received extensive scrutiny. The\npurpose of this letter is to articulate the propagation dynamics of radiative\nMHD jets in the context of the extensive jet literature. Most importantly, we\nlook for morphological and kinematic diagnostics that may distinguish\nhydrodynamic protostellar jets from their magnetically dominated cousins. Our\nsimulations are axisymmetric (2.5-D). A toroidal B_phi field geometry is used.\nOur models have high sonic Mach numbers (Ms approx 10), but lower fast mode\nMach number (Mf approx 5). This is approximately the case for jets formed via\ndisk-wind or X-wind models - currently the consensus choice for launching and\ncollimating YSO jets. Time-dependent radiative losses are included via a\ncoronal cooling curve. Our results demonstrate that the morphology and\npropagation characteristics of strongly magnetized radiative jets can differ\nsignificantly from jets with weak fields. In particular the formation of\nnose-cones via post-shock hoop stresses leads to narrow bow shocks and enhanced\nbow shock speeds. In addition, the hoop stresses produce strong shocks in the\njet beam which constrasts with the relatively unperturbed beam in radiative\nhydrodynamic jets.

These effects describe\nthe dynamical influence of the accelerated cosmic rays on the shocked plasma at\nthe same time as addressing how the non-uniformities in the fluid flow force\nthe distribution of the cosmic rays to deviate from pure power-laws. Such\ndeviations are crucial to gamma-ray spectral determination.

We demonstrate how the spatial and temporal\nlimitations imposed by the expanding SNR shell quench acceleration above\ncritical energies in the 500 GeV - 10 TeV range, thereby spawning gamma-ray\nspectral cutoffs that are quite consistent with Whipple's TeV upper limits to\nthe EGRET unidentified sources that have SNR associations.

We find that the\nHall conductivity is related in a simple way to Floquet energies (associated to\nthe Schroedinger equation in the co-moving frame). By this relation one can\nanalyze the dependence of the Hall conductivity from the electric field.\nSub-bands can be introduced by the time average of the expectation value of the\nHamiltonian on the Floquet states. Moreover we prove previous results in form\nof sum rules as, for instance: the topological character of the Hall\nconductivity (being an integer multiple of e^2/h), the Diofantine equation\nwhich constrains the Hall conductivity by the rational number which measures\nthe flux of the magnetic field through the periodicity cell. The Schroedinger\nequation fixes in a natural way the phase of the wave function over the reduced\nBrillouin zone: thus the topological invariant providing the Hall conductivity\ncan be evaluated numerically without ambiguity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 1997 14:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 1997 12:26:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 1998 10:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

Such an equation has found applications in\nphysics, mainly in quantum optics, but not in its full generality. It has been\nused to give, at least approximately, the dynamics of photoemissive sources\nsuch as an atom absorbing and emitting light or matter in an optical cavity,\nwhich exchanges light with the surrounding free space. But in these cases the\npossibility of introducing the gauge (or number) process in the dynamical\nequation has not been considered. In this paper we show, in the case of the\nsimplest photoemissive source, namely a two-level atom stimulated by a laser,\nhow the full Hudson-Parthasarathy equation allows to describe in a consistent\nway not only absorption and emission, but also the elastic scattering of the\nlight by the atom. Morever, we study the differential and total cross sections\nfor the scattering of laser light by the atom, as a function of the frequency\nof the stimulating laser. The resulting line-shape is very interesting. Not\nonly a Lorentzian shape is permitted, but the full variety of Fano profiles can\nbe obtained. The dependence of the line shape on the intensity of the\nstimulating laser is computed; in particular, the resonance position turns out\nto be intensity dependent, a phenomenon known as lamp shift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 1997 08:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
