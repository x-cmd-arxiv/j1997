The adapted Gamma-series is a\nfunction $\\Psi$ with values in the finite dimensional vector space\n$R_{A,T}\\otimes C$. Applications of these results in the context of toric\nMirror Symmetry are described. Building on work of Batyrev we show that the\nrelative cohomology module of a certain hypersurface in a torus is a GKZ\nhypergeometric $D$-module which over an appropriate domain is isomorphic to the\ntrivial $D$-module $R_{A,T}\\otimes O_T$, where $O_T$ is the sheaf of\nholomorphic functions on this domain. The isomorphism is explicitly given by\nadapted Gamma-series. As a result one finds the periods of a holomorphic\ndifferential form of degree $d$ on a $d$-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold,\nneeded for the B-model side input to Mirror Symmetry. Relating our work with\nthat of Batyrev and Borisov we interpret the ring $\\cR_{\\sA,\\gT}$ as the\ncohomology ring of a toric variety and a certain principal ideal in it as a\nsubring of the Chow ring of a Calabi-Yau complete intersection.

They lead to generalizations of Laplace\noperators, Fourier transforms, heat semigroups, Hermite polynomials, and so on.\nIn this paper we introduce two systems of biorthogonal polynomials with respect\nto Dunkl's Gaussian distributions in a quite canonical way. These systems,\ncalled Appell systems, admit many properties known from classical Hermite\npolynomials, and turn out to be useful for the analysis of Dunkl's Gaussian\ndistributions. In particular, these polynomials lead to a new proof of a\ngeneralized formula of Macdonald due to Dunkl.\n  The ideas for this paper are taken from recent works on non-Gaussian white\nnoise analysis and from the umbral calculus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 1997 15:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
