We propose that\nthe two bands relevant for the cuprates are comprised of Cu dx2-y2, dz2, planar\nO psigma, and apical O pz orbitals. Along the diagonal, kx=ky in the Brillouin\nzone, the two band Fermi surfaces may cross. We associate the optimal doping\nfor the highest Tc with this point because only in the vicinity of this\ntouching point are inter-band Cooper pairs energetically possible. Due to the\nlack of time reversal invariance of an inter-band Cooper pair with itself, the\nstandard interpretation of Josephson tunneling is altered such that the\ndetailed nature of the single particle tunneling matrix elements contributes to\nthe supercurrent. The dx2-y2 gap observations from Josephson tunneling are\nshown to arise from our model with pairing due to phonons. A Hubbard model is\nwritten down for the two bands at the Fermi energy with realistic parameters\nfor LaSrCuO. The anomalous normal state features in the nmr are calculated and\nqualitatively explained as due to the character of the two bands in the\nvicinity of the crossing point. The Hall effect is calculated using standard\nBloch-Boltzmann transport theory. The observed strong temperature dependence of\nthe Hall coefficient is reproduced and is due to the strong reshaping of the\ncurrent carrying band Fermi surface due to band repulsion with the other band\nfor dopings very close to the Fermi surface touching point. Reasonable\nquantitative agreement is also obtained for the nmr and Hall effect. A linear\nresistivity at optimal doping is expected due to the proximity of the second\nband in k space which can strongly relax the current and the \"smallness\" of the\ncurrent carrying Fermi surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 1997 00:18:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 1997 07:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

A new time scale emerges\nthat separates the linear from the non-linear regimes. This scale is non-\nperturbative in the coupling and initial amplitude. The non-perturbative\nevolution is studied in the large the N limit for the O(N) vector model. A\ncombination of numerical analysis and the multitime scale analysis reveals the\npresence of unstable bands in the nonlinear regime. These are associated with\npower law growth of quantum fluctuations, that result in power law relaxation\nand dissipation with non-universal and non-perturbative dynamical anomalous\nexponents.We find substantial particle production during this non-linear evolu-\ntion which is of the same order as that in the linear regime. The expectation\nvalue of the scalar field vanishes asymptotically transferring all of the\ninitial energy into produced particles via the non-linear resonances in the\nunbroken symmetry phase.The effective mass for the quantum modes tends asympto-\ntically to a constant plus oscillating O(1/t) terms. This slow decay causes the\npower behaviour in the modes which become free for t=infty.

For certain homogeneous\nstar products of Weyl ordered type (which we have obtained from a Fedosov type\nprocedure in part I, see q-alg/9707030) we construct differential operator\nrepresentations via the formal GNS construction (see q-alg/9607019). The\npositive linear functional is integration over $Q$ with respect to some fixed\ndensity and is shown to yield a reasonable version of the Schr\\\"odinger\nrepresentation where a Weyl ordering prescription is incorporated. Furthermore\nwe discuss simple examples like free particle Hamiltonians (defined by a\nRiemannian metric on $Q$) and the implementation of certain diffeomorphisms of\n$Q$ to unitary transformations in the GNS (pre-)Hilbert space and of time\nreversal maps (involutive anti-symplectic diffeomorphisms of $T^*Q$) to\nanti-unitary transformations. We show that the fixed-point set of any\ninvolutive time reversal map is either empty or a Lagrangean submanifold.\nMoreover, we compare our approach to concepts using integral formulas of\ngeneralized Moyal-Weyl type. Furthermore we show that the usual WKB expansion\nwith respect to a projectable Lagrangean submanifold can be formulated by a GNS\nconstruction. Finally we prove that any homogeneous star product on any\ncotangent bundle is strongly closed, i. e. the integral over $T^*Q$ w.r.t. the\nsymplectic volume vanishes on star-commutators. An alternative Fedosov type\ndeduction of the star product of standard ordered type using a deformation of\nthe algebra of symmetric contravariant tensor fields is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 1997 11:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
