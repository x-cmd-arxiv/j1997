We consider combinatorial problems about free groups, polynomial\nalgebras, free associative and Lie algebras. Our main idea is to study\nautomorphisms and, more generally, homomorphisms of various algebraic systems\nby means of their action on ``very small\" sets of elements, as opposed to a\ntraditional approach of studying their action on subsystems (like subgroups,\nnormal subgroups; subalgebras, ideals, etc.) We will show that there is a lot\nthat can be said about a homomorphism, given its action on just a single\nelement, if this element is ``good enough\". Then, we consider somewhat bigger\nsets of elements, like, for example, automorphic orbits, and study a variety of\ninteresting problems arising in that framework.\n  One more point that we make here is that one can use similar combinatorial\nideas in seemingly distant areas of algebra, like, for example, group theory\nand commutative algebra. In particular, we use the same language of\n``elementary transformations\" in different contexts and show that this approach\nappears to be quite fruitful for all the areas involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 1997 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}
