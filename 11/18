Although the ZA\ncorrectly reproduces the linear growing modes of density and velocity\nperturbations, non-linear growth is inaccurately represented because of the ZA\nfailure to conserve momentum. This implies that it takes time for the actual\ndynamics to establish the correct statistical properties of density and\nvelocity fields. We extend perturbation theory (PT) to include transients as\nnon-linear excitations of decaying modes caused by the IC. We focus on\nhigher-order statistics of the density contrast and velocity divergence,\ncharacterized by the S_p and T_p parameters. We find that the time-scale of\ntransients is determined, at a given order p, by the spectral index n. The\nskewness factor S_3 (T_3) attains 10% accuracy only after a=6 (a=15) for n=0,\nwhereas higher (lower) n demands more (less) expansion away from the IC. These\nrequirements become much more stringent as p increases. An Omega=0.3 model\nrequires a factor of two larger expansion than an Omega=1 model to reduce\ntransients by the same amount. The predicted transients in S_p are in good\nagreement with numerical simulations. More accurate IC can be achieved by using\n2nd order Lagrangian PT (2LPT), which reproduces growing modes up to 2nd order\nand thus eliminates transients in the skewness. We show that for p>3 this\nreduces the required expansion by more than an order of magnitude compared to\nthe ZA. Setting up 2LPT IC only requires minimal, inexpensive changes to ZA\ncodes. We suggest simple steps for its implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 1997 23:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

This\nscenario involves at least two scalar fields, the inflaton field $\\phi$, and\nthe symmetry breaking field $\\sigma$. We found that the behavior of these\nfields after inflation, as well as the possibility of preheating (particle\nproduction due to parametric resonance), depends crucially on the ratio of the\ncoupling constant $\\lambda$ (self-interaction of the field $\\sigma$) to the\ncoupling constant $g^2$ (interaction of $\\phi$ and $\\sigma$). For $\\lambda \\gg\ng^2$, the oscillations of the field $\\sigma$ soon after inflation become very\nsmall, and all the energy is concentrated in the oscillating field $\\phi$. For\n$\\lambda \\sim g^2$ both fields $\\sigma$ and $\\phi$ oscillate in a rather\nchaotic way, but eventually their motion stabilizes, and parametric resonance\nwith production of $\\chi$ particles becomes possible. For $\\lambda \\ll g^2$ the\noscillations of the field $\\phi$ soon after inflation become very small, and\nall the energy is concentrated in the oscillating field $\\sigma$. Preheating\ncan be efficient if the effective masses of the fields $\\phi$ and $\\sigma$ are\nmuch greater than the Hubble constant, or if these fields are coupled to other\nlight scalar (or vector) fields $\\chi$. In the recently proposed hybrid models\nwith a second stage of inflation after the phase transition, both preheating\nand usual reheating are inefficient. Therefore for a very long time the\nuniverse remains in a state with vanishing pressure. As a result, density\ncontrasts generated during the phase transition in these models can grow and\ncollapse to form primordial black holes. Under certain conditions, most of the\nenergy density after inflation will be stored in small black holes, which will\nlater evaporate and reheat the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 1997 07:19:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Dec 1997 01:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The simulated action potential and the five currents in\nthe model are in excellent agreement with experiments.

The waveguide contains a\nbarrier, namely a region of a lower dielectric constant compared to the\nneighboring regions. This set-up yields a purely imaginary wave vector in the\nregion of the barrier ('electromagnetic tunneling'). We exactly calculate the\ntime-dependent Green's function for a slightly simplified dispersion relation.\nIn order to observe the plain tunneling effect we neglect the distortions\ncaused by the wave guide in obtaining the transmitted pulse. The wave front of\nthe pulse travels with the vacuum speed of light. Nevertheless, behind the\nbarrier, the maximum of the transmitted pulse turns up at an earlier time than\nin the case without an barrier.
