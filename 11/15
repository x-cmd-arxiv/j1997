The supersymmetry\nbreaking is mediated to the minimal supersymmetric standard model sector by the\n`preon' superfields which compose the quarks in the first two generations. To\nobtain an experimentally acceptable mass spectrum, the scalar quarks in the\nfirst two generations need masses of order 10 TeV, while the other\nsuperpartners need masses less than 1 TeV.

Originally entangledness was introduced in\norder to get narrow Boolean algebras and examples of the nonmultiplicativity of\nc.c-ness. These applications became marginal when the hope to extract new such\nobjects or strong colourings were not materialized, but after the pcf\nconstructions which made their debut in [Sh:g] it seems that this notion gained\nindependence. Generally we aim at characterizing the existence strong and weak\nentangled orders in cardinal arithmetic terms. In [Sh462] necessary conditions\nwere shown for strong entangledness which in a previous version was erroneously\nproved to be equivalent to plain entangledness. In section 1 we give a forcing\ncounterexample to this equivalence and in section 2 we get those results for\nentangledness (certainly the most interesting case). In section 3 we get weaker\nresults for positively entangledness, especially when supplemented with the\nexistence of a separating point. An antipodal case is defined and completely\ncharacterized.
