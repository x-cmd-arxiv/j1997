The equation of motion for the\nunified theory is derived and leads to a Higgs field. The thermodynamic\nproperties of Q are discussed and yield a consistent amplitude for the cosmic\nmicrowave background fluctuations. The manifold Q possesses internal energy\nscales which are independent of the field theory defined on it, but which\nconstrain the predicted mass hierarchy of such theories.
