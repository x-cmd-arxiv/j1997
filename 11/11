This hypothesis is based on a\nnumber of speculative assumptions about the properties of Galactic and\nintergalactic magnetic fields. The intergalactic cosmic-ray density expected\nunder conservative assumptions about its extragalactic origins is then shown to\nbe of the right order of magnitude to account for the locally observed cosmic\nradiation.

Therefore stellar\nmass to light ratios can be determined from x-ray observations! Also the widely\nused ``mass dropout'' assumption must be incorrect in this important part of\nthe cooling flow. Recent ROSAT observations indicate gas temperatures in excess\nof the virial stellar temperature, totally unlike standard cooling flow models.\nHowever, these new results can be understood if an additional massive component\nof ``circumgalactic'' gas is assumed to fill the outer galactic halos beyond\nmost of the stars. This old hot gas, first heated during the epoch of galaxy\nformation, continues to flow into the stellar parts of ellipticals today,\ncombining with gas expelled from evolving stars. This dual origin of hot\ninterstellar gas further complicates recent discussions of abundances in the\nhot interstellar gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 1997 23:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We consider three types of regions:\n(i) \"isolated charge-free\" region (where all electric fields, generated by\ncharges outside that particular region, are zero), for example, inside a hollow\nconductor of any shape or in a free-charge Universe; (ii) ``non-isolated\ncharge-free\" region (where all electric fields, generated by charges outside\nthat particular region, are not zero) and (iii) \"charge-neutral\" region (where\npoint charges exist but their algebraic sum is zero). The paper notes that\nthere are two families of solutions: (1) In \"isolated charge-free\" regions\nelectric free field does not exist in the context of Maxwell's equations, but\nthere may exist a time-independent background magnetic field. (2) In both\n\"charge-neutral\" and \"non-isolated charge-free\" regions where the homogeneous\ncondition \\varrho=0 also holds, Maxwell's equation for electric field have\nnon-zero solution, as in the conventional view, but this solution is not free\nfield.

We examine the proposition that it is\nphysically meaningful to treat the volume elements of these metrics as\ndensities-of-states for thermodynamic purposes. In the n = 2 (spin-1/2) case,\nuse of the maximal monotone metric, in fact, does lead to the adoption of the\nLangevin (and not the Brillouin) functions, thus, completely conforming with a\nrecent probabilistic argument of Lavenda. Brody and Hughston also arrived at\nthe Langevin function in an analysis based on the Fubini-Study metric. It is a\nmatter of some interest, however, that in the first (subsequently modified)\nversion of their paper, they had reported a different result, one fully\nconsistent with the alternative use of the minimal monotone metric. In this\npart I of our investigation, we first study scenarios involving partially\nentangled spin-1/2 particles (n = 4, 6,...) and then a certain three-level\nextension of the two-level systems. In part II, we examine, in full generality,\nand with some limited analytical success, the cases n = 3 and 4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 1997 19:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 1997 23:27:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 1997 18:36:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 1997 22:45:32 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 1997 00:15:35 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 1997 00:34:28 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 1998 15:42:40 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 11 May 1998 16:51:13 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 1998 21:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
