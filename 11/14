At least 8 spectra from each burst were fitted with a\nspectral form that consisted of a low-energy power law, a spectral break at\nmiddle energies and a high-energy continuum. In most bursts (122), the\nhigh-energy continuum was consistent with a power law. The evolution of the\nfitted high-energy power-law index over the selected spectra for each burst is\ninconsistent with a constant for 34% of the total sample. The sample\ndistribution of the average value for the index from each burst is fairly\nnarrow, centered on -2.12.

Qualitatively, we attribute these\nfeatures to the presence of `stress paths', whose geometry depends on the\nconstruction history and controls the propagation of stresses. Stress paths can\ncause random focussing of stresses (large fluctuations) as well as systematic\ndeflections (arching). We describe simple physical models that capture some of\nthese effects. In these models, the `stress paths' become identified with the\ncharacteristic `light rays' of wavelike (hyperbolic) equations for force\npropagation. Such models account for the `pressure dip' below conical sandpiles\nbuilt by pouring from a point source, and explain qualitatively the large\nstress fluctuations observed experimentally in granular matter. The differences\nbetween this approach and more conventional modelling strategies (based on\nelastoplastic or rigid-plastic models) are highlighted, focusing on the role of\nboundary conditions.

The first chapter gives a corresponding analysis\nof Maxwell theory and introduces the new equations. The second chapter gives a\nfull account of the results, including the photon-like solutions, in the vacuum\ncase. A new concept, called scale factor, is defined and successfully used. Two\nways for describing the intrinsic angular momentum are given. Interference of\ntwo photon-like solutions is also considered. The third chapter considers\ninteraction with external fields (continuous media) on the base of establishing\ncorrespondence between the physical concept of nondissipation and the\nmathematical concept of integrability of Pfaff systems.
