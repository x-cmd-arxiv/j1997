The diffuse gamma-ray intensity due to\nunresolved pulsars is directly linked to the number of objects which should be\nobserved in the EGRET data. We can therefore use our knowledge of the\nunidentified EGRET sources to constrain model parameters like the pulsar birth\nrate, their beaming angle, etc. This analysis is based only on the properties\nof the six pulsars which have been identified in the EGRET data, and is\nindependent of choice of a pulsar emission model. We find that pulsars\ncontribute very little to the diffuse emission at lower energies, whereas above\n1 GeV they can account for 18% of the observed intensity in selected regions\nfor a reasonable number of directly observable gamma-ray pulsars (14). The\nlatitude distribution of the diffuse emission caused by unresolved pulsars is\nnarrower than that of the observed diffuse emission. While the excess above 1\nGeV gamma-ray energy is observed up to at least 6-8 degrees off the plane, the\npulsar contribution would be small there. Thus pulsars do significantly\ncontribute to the diffuse galactic gamma-ray emission above 1 GeV, but they can\nnot be made responsible for all the discrepancy between observed intensity and\nmodel predictions in this energy range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 1997 10:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For the simplest model with the\nnearest-neighbor quadrupolar interaction, the transition temperature and the\nspecific heat are derived by the use of the recently proposed effective medium\ntheory. It is shown that magnetic field H has two competing effects on the\nquadrupolar ordering; one is to encourage the ordering by suppressing the\nfluctuation among different components of order parameters, and the other is to\nblock the ordering as in antiferromagnets. The former is found to be of order\nH^2 and the latter of order H^4. Hence the fluctuation is suppressed for weak\nfields, and the transition temperature increases with magnetic field.

We then\nconsider nonaxisymmetric ellipsoidal deformations of the configurations,\nholding J constant and the rotation uniform, and we locate the point at which\nthe bar modes will be driven secularly unstable by a dissipative agent like\nviscosity. We find that the value of the eccentricity, as well as the ratios\n\\Omega^2/(\\pi\\rho_0) and T/|W|, defined invariantly, all increase at the onset\nof instability as the stars become more relativistic. Since higher degrees of\nrotation are required to trigger a viscosity-driven bar mode as the star's\ncompactness increases, the effect of GR is to weaken the instability, at least\nto PN order. This behavior is opposite to that found for secular instability\nvia Dedekind-like modes driven unstable by gravitational radiation, supporting\nthe suggestion that in GR, nonaxisymmetric modes driven unstable by viscosity\nand gravitational radiation may no longer coincide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 1997 10:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
