For this family stellar velocity dispersion values and stability\nparameters were calculated, showing that the more massive discs, although\nhaving larger dispersions, are less stable. However, a reliable theoretical\ndescription of the inner regions where the drop occurs cannot be given.\n  That is why we have resorted to numerical calculations. Pure stellar 3d\nsimulations have been performed for the family of decompositions.

For an adopted equal\nmass-to-light ratio of disc and nucleus, a velocity dispersion of 21.5 km/s is\npredicted, in excellent agreement with the observed central value.
