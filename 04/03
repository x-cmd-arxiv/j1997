The dispersion of the n-M relation is indeed large. However, we argue\nthat this scatter is not due to the depth of the Virgo cluster, but is\nessentially intrinsic.

The analysis of Young & Currie (1995)\nis hampered by the use of low-resolution photometry and flawed by the\nassumption that the n-M and n-R relations can be used independently.

(To be more precise requires much more knowledge\nof B,L-generating mechanisms than we currently have.) Electromagnetic helicity\ngeneration is associated (indirectly) with the generation of electroweak\nChern-Simons number through B+L anomalies. This helicity, which in the early\nuniverse is some 30 orders of magnitude greater than what would be expected\nfrom fluctuations alone in the absence of B+L violation, should be reasonably\nwell-conserved through the evolution of the universe to around the times of\nmatter dominance and decoupling, because the early universe is an excellent\nconductor. Possible consequences include early structure formation; macroscopic\nmanifestations of CP violation in the cosmic magnetic field (measurable at\nleast in principle, if not in practice); and an inverse-cascade dynamo\nmechanism in which magnetic fields and helicity are unstable to transfer to\nlarger and larger spatial scales.

However, since the\nexisting calculations are based on coordinate-space representation, they\ninvolve a number of simplifying assumptions about the energy-momentum flow in\nthe rescattering diagram, even though the delicate interplay between the\none-body and two-body terms makes it desirable to avoid these kinematical\nassumptions.
