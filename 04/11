We propose\na systematic approach to identify these divisors, and derive some criteria to\ndetermine whether a given divisor indeed contributes. We then apply our\ntechniques in explicit examples, in particular, when the base B of the elliptic\nfibration is a toric variety or a Fano 3-fold. When B is Fano, we show how\ndivisors contributing to the superpotential are always \"exceptional\" (in some\nsense) for the Calabi-Yau 4-fold X. This naturally leads to certain transitions\nof X, that is birational transformations to a singular model (where the image\nof D no longer contributes) as well as certain smoothings of the singular\nmodel. If a smoothing exists, then the Hodge numbers change. We speculate that\ndivisors contributing to the superpotential are always \"exceptional\" (in some\nsense) for X, also in M-theory. In fact we show that this is a consequence of\nthe (log)-minimal model algorithm in dimension 4, which is still conjectural in\nits generality, but it has been worked out in various cases, among which toric\nvarieties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 1997 18:12:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Apr 1997 15:03:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 1998 20:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

One of the primary goals of the survey is to better quantify\nthe faint end of the luminosity function of active galactic nuclei. This paper\ndescribes the subset of nuclei showing definite or probable evidence of broad\nH-alpha emission. We outline the procedures for determining the presence of\nthis elusive spectral feature, steps for its quantitative measurement, and the\nassociated systematic errors. Of the 211 emission-line galaxies classified as\nhaving Seyfert or LINER nuclei in our survey, the broad H-alpha line was\ndetected with confidence in 34 objects, and with less certainty in another 12.\nMost of the detections are reported for the first time, and the detection rate\nrepresents a lower limit to the true incidence of active nuclei harboring a\nbroad emission-line region. These statistics imply that broad-lined active\nnuclei are much more common than previously believed: they exist in at least\n20% of all galaxies spectroscopically classified as \"active\" and in more than\n10% of all luminous galaxies at the current epoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 1997 15:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-09"}
