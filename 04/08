We have incorporated many of the effects missing from\nearlier 1-D treatments: improved modelling of the dark matter and galaxy\ndistributions, cosmologically realistic evolution of the cluster potential, and\nthe effects of a multiphase cooling flow. The model utilises a fairly standard\n1-D Lagrangian hydrodynamical code to calculate the evolution of the\nintracluster gas. This is coupled to a theoretical model for the growth of dark\nmatter density perturbations. The main advantages of this treatment over 3-D\ncodes are (1) improved spatial resolution within the cooling flow region, (2)\nmuch faster execution time, allowing a fuller exploration of parameter space,\nand (3) the inclusion of additional physics.\n  In the present paper, we explore the development of infall models -- in which\ngas relaxes into a deepening potential well -- covering a wide range of cluster\nmass scales. We find that such simple models reproduce many of the global\nproperties of observed clusters. Very strong cooling flows develop in these 1-D\ncluster models. In practice, disruption by major mergers probably reduces the\ncooling rate in most clusters.

For spinless fermions the\nrepulsive side is strongly localized whereas the system with attractive\ninteractions is stable with respect to disorder, at variance with the single\nchain case. For fermions with spins, the repulsive side is also localized, and\nin particular the d-wave superconducting phase found for the pure system is\ntotally destroyed by an arbitrarily small amount of disorder.
