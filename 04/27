Bearing this in mind we decide to\nbe eclectic and define two new sets of statistics to quantify the level of\nnon-Gaussianity. Both sets make use of the concept of cumulants of a\ndistribution. However, one set is defined in real space, with reference to the\nwavelet transform, whereas the other is defined in Fourier space. We derive a\nseries of properties concerning these statistics for a Gaussian random field\nand show how one can relate these quantities to the higher order moments of\ntemperature maps. Although our frameworks lead to an infinite hierarchy of\nquantities we show how cosmic variance and experimental constraints give a\nnatural truncation of this hierarchy.
