The Li excesses are more\nconspicuous for masses in the range 0.75-0.95 Mo, indicating that the rate of\nLi depletion has been less pronounced in CABS than in single stars. This\nphenomenon is interpreted in the context of transport of angular momentum from\nthe orbit to the stellar rotation due to tidal effects. Other explanations,\nhowever, can not be ruled out. This is the case of transport of material\ninduced by internal gravity waves, which could be inhibited due to the presence\nof strong magnetic fields associated with the effective dynamo in CABS.
