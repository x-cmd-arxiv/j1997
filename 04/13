We\ngive a very simple cohomological definition of these weights in terms of the\nAtiyah class of X (the obstruction to existence of a holomorphic connection).\nWe show that the analogy between the tensor of curvature of a hyperKaehler\nmetric and the tensor of structure constants of a Lie algebra observed by\nRozansky and Witten, holds in fact for any complex manifold, if we work on the\nlevel of cohomology and for any Kaehler manifold, if we work on the level of\nDolbeault forms. In particular, for any sheaf A of commutative algebras on any\ncomplex manifold the shifted cohomology of the tangent sheaf tensored with A is\na graded Lie algebra. We also show that a certain system of Gilkey-type\ncomplexes of \"natural tensors\" on Kaehler manifolds is, up to suspension\n(accounting for various changes of signs), identified with the PROP (in the\nsense of Adams and MacLane) describing Lie algebras \"up to higher homotopies\".\nAs an outcome of our considerations, we give a formula for the Rozansky-Witten\nclasses using any Kaehler metric on a holomorphic symplectic manifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Apr 1997 00:57:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 1997 17:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

We present several new results\nregarding the model predictions, and show that X-ray to optical observations of\nGRB970228 and GRB970402 are naturally explained by the model: The scaling of\nflux with time and frequency agrees with model predictions and requires a power\nlaw distribution of shock accelerated electrons, dlog N/dlog E=2.3+-0.1\n(implying, and consistent with the observed, 1/t decline of flux observed at a\ngiven frequency); The absolute flux value agrees with that inferred through the\nmodel from observed gamma-ray fluence. The future after-glow emission of these\nbursts is predicted. The observations indicate that the ratio of magnetic field\nto equipartition value and the fraction F of dissipated kinetic energy carried\nby electrons are not much smaller than 1. More frequent observations at a fixed\nwavelength, or a wide spectrum at a fixed time, would put strong constraints on\nthese parameters. We show that inverse-Compton scattering suppresses X-ray/\noptical emission at delays t<T=10(F/0.3)^4 hr. Observations therefore imply\nF<0.3. The strong dependence of T on F implies that T may vary widely from\nburst to burst, and that frequent X-ray/optical observations at t~T would\ndetermine F. For F~0.2, inverse-Compton emission dominates during the first\n2hr, producing >1GeV photons and providing a natural explanation to the delayed\nGeV emission observed in several strong bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Apr 1997 06:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
