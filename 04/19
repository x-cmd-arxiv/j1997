Consideration of the bias in the distance to the Virgo cluster raises\nthis distance and lowers the calculated value of H_0. Monte Carlo simulations\nof the cluster have been run for several possible distributions of spirals\nwithin the cluster and of clusters in the local universe.

The 1.76MeV E0\ntransition in Zr90 (Sr source) and the 1.77MeV M1 transition in Pb207 (Bi\nsource) have been investigated experimentally using the essentially improved\nset-up at the double-ORANGE beta-spectrometer of GSI. The measurements prove\nthe capability of the setup to cleanly identify the IPC pairs in the presence\nof five orders of magnitude higher beta- and gamma background from the same\nsource and to yield essentially background-free sum spectra despite the large\nbackground. Using the ability of the ORANGE setup to directly determine the\nopening angle of the e+e- pairs, the angular correlation of the emitted pairs\nwas measured. In the Zr90 case the correlation could be deduced for a wide\nrange of energy differences of the pairs. The Zr90 results are in good\nagreement with recent theory. The angular correlation deduced for the M1\ntransition in Pb207 is in strong disagreement with theoretical predictions\nderived within the Born approximation and shows almost isotropic character.\nThis is again in agreement with the new theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 1997 22:56:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 1998 15:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
