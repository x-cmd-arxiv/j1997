In the Feynman\npresentation of Einstein theory an hypothesis concerning the interaction of\ngravity to gravity, which was hidden in the original version, becomes explicit.\nThis is nothing but the assumed extension of the validity of the equivalence\nprinciple not only for matter-gravity interaction, but also for\ngravity-gravity. Recently we have presented a field theory of gravity (from\nhere on called the NDL theory) which does not contain such a hypothesis. We\nhave shown that, for this theory, both the cosmological structure and the PPN\napproximation for the solar tests are satisfied.\n  The proposal of this paper is to go one step further and to show that NDL\ntheory is able to solve the problem of radiation emission by a binary pulsar in\nthe same degree of accuracy as it was done in the GR theory. In the\npost-Newtonian order of approximation we show that the quadrupole formula of\nthis theory is equal to the corresponding one in general relativity. Thus, the\nunique actual observable distinction of these theories concerns the velocity of\ngravitational waves, which becomes then the true ultimate test for gravity\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 1997 19:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
