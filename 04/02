These criteria have no\nclassical analogue. As an example, we provide a four-bit code which corrects\nfor a single amplitude damping error. This code violates the usual Hamming\nbound calculated for a Pauli description of the error process, and does not fit\ninto the GF(4) classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 1997 06:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
