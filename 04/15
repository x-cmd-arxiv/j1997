Except when a nearly precise orbital resonance occurs (i.e., the mode\nfrequency equals multiple of the orbital frequency), $\\Delta E_s$ is very close\nto the steady-state mode energy in the tide in the presence of dissipation. It\nis shown that stellar rotation can change the strength of dynamical tide\nsignificantly. In particular, retrograde rotation with respect to the orbit\nincreases the energy transfer by bringing lower-order g-modes (or f-mode for\nconvective stars), which couple more strongly to the tidal potential, into\ncloser resonances with the orbital motion of the companion.\n  We apply our general formalism to the problems of tidal capture binary\nformation and the orbital evolution of PSR J0045-7319/B-star binary.

Instead, most of their stars form at modest rates\nin disk galaxies, which then merge to form the ellipticals. 2)Galaxies do not\nundergo closed-box chemical evolution. Instead, metals can be transferred\nbetween the stars, cold gas and the hot gas halos of the galaxies. It is\nassumed that metals are ejected out of disk galaxies during supernova\nexplosions and these metals enter the hot gas component. The fact that metals\nare more easily ejected from small galaxies leads to the establishment of a\nmass-metallicity relation for the disk systems. Big ellipticals are more metal\nrich because they are formed from the mergers of bigger disks. We use\nsemi-analytic techniques to follow the formation, evolution, and chemical\nenrichment of cluster ellipticals in a merging hierarchy of dark matter halos.\nThe inclusion of the new metallicity-dependent spectral synthesis models of\nBruzual & Charlot allow us to compute the colours, line indices and mass-to-\nlight ratios of these galaxies.

We show that a natural\ngeneralization of Simon's problem can be solved in this way, whereas previous\nalgorithms required quantum polynomial time in the expected sense only, without\nupper bounds on the worst-case running time. This is achieved by generalizing\nboth Simon's and Grover's algorithms and combining them in a novel way. It\nfollows that there is a decision problem that can be solved in exact quantum\npolynomial time, which would require expected exponential time on any classical\nbounded-error probabilistic computer if the data is supplied as a black box.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 1997 23:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}
