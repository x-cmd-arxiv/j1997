This assertion is commonly considered to be a fundamental law of\nthermodynamics. As such, it seems to spoil the otherwise perfect analogy\nbetween the ordinary laws of thermodynamics and the laws of black hole\nmechanics, since rotating black holes in general relativity do not satisfy the\nanalog of the ``Nernst theorem''. The main purpose of this paper is to attempt\nto lay to rest the ``Nernst theorem'' as a law of thermodynamics. We consider a\nboson (or fermion) ideal gas with its total angular momentum, $J$, as an\nadditional state parameter, and we analyze the conditions on the single\nparticle density of states, $g(\\epsilon,j)$, needed for the Nernst formulation\nof the third law to hold.

Due to the time-dependent particle evaporation off\nthe hadronic surface in the latter approach the hadron ratios change (by\nfactors of $<\\approx 5$) in time. Final particle yields reflect time averages\nover the actual thermodynamic properties of the system at a certain stage of\nthe evolution. Calculated hadron, strangelet and (anti-)cluster yields as well\nas freeze-out times are presented for different systems. Due to strangeness\ndistillation the system moves rapidly out of the T, $\\mu_q$ plane into the\n$\\mu_s$-sector. Strangeness to baryon ratios f_s=1-2 prevail during a\nconsiderable fraction (50%) of the time evolution (i.e. $\\Lambda$-droplets or\neven $\\Xi^-$-droplets form the system at the late stage: The possibility of\nobserving this time evolution via HBT correlations is discussed). The observed\nhadron ratios require $T_c\\approx 160 MeV$ and $B^{1/4}>\\approx 200 MeV$. If\nthe present model is fit to the extrapolated hadron yields, metastable\nhypermatter can only be produced with a probability $p< 10^{-8}$ for $A \\ge 4$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 1997 15:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}
