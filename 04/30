Future microwave anisotropy\nsatellites will be able to detect this signature. The production and mixing of\nmetals by an early population of stars provides a natural explanation to the\nmetallicity, ~1% solar, found in the intergalactic medium at redshifts z<5.

We\nsuggest an explanation of the observed deviations of the conductance from the\nuniversal value $G=2e^2/h$ per channel in the wire. We argue that the new quasi\nplateau observed for the conductance at the value $G=1.4e^2/h$ is a result of\nthe proximity between the spin polarized phase and the metallic one. The\nenhancement of the conductance from the value $G=e^2/h$ to $G=1.4e^2/h$ is due\nto the hybridization of the electronic state at $K_F^{\\downarrow}\\approx 0$\nwith the chiral states at $K_F^{\\uparrow}$ and $-K_F^{\\uparrow}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 1997 15:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

In\nparticular, the requirement of an invariance under rotations around the\ntransverse axes is difficult to fulfill.In the present work it is investigated,\nto which extent rotational invariance is restored in the solution of a\nlight-cone quantized field theory. The positronium spectrum in full (3+1)\ndimensions is calculated at an unphysically large coupling of alpha=0.3 to be\nsensitive for terms breaking rotational invariance and to accustomize the\ntheory to future QCD applications. The numerical accuracy of the formalism is\nimproved to allow for the calculation of mass eigenvalues for arbitrary\ncomponents J_z of the total angular momentum. We find numerically degenerate\neigenvalues as expected from rotationally invariant formalisms and the right\nmultiplet structures up to large principal quantum numbers.

This enlargement of the model is non-trivial and a consistency check\nof the underlying theory of effective interactions.
