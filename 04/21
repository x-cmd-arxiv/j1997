While there exists\ninsufficient data to conclusively determine the origin of this excess, one\npossibility is that it is due to a new leptoquark at mass scale around 200 GeV.\nWe examine the type of leptoquark states that exist in superstring derived\nstandard-like models, and show that, while these models may contain the\nstandard leptoquark states which exist in Grand Unified Theories, they also\ngenerically contain new and exotic leptoquark states with fractional lepton\nnumber, $\\pm1/2$. In contrast to the traditional GUT-type leptoquark states,\nthe couplings of the exotic leptoquarks to the Standard Model states are\ngenerated after the breaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$. This important feature of the\nexotic leptoquark states may result in local discrete symmetries which forbid\nsome of the undesired leptoquark couplings. We examine these couplings in\nseveral models and study the phenomenological implications. The flavor\nsymmetries of the superstring models are found to naturally suppress leptoquark\nflavor changing processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 1997 03:51:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 1997 20:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
