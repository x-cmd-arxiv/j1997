The role\nof the anisotropy of the medium in producing different universality classes is\nelucidated. The last two lectures focus on the dynamics of lines, where\ntransverse fluctuations are also important. We shall demonstrate how various\nnon-linearities appear in the dynamics of driven flux lines. The universality\nclasses of depinning, and also dynamic roughening, are illustrated in the\ncontexts of moving flux lines, advancing crack fronts, and drifting polymers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 1997 16:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
