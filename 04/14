We\nrestrict our analysis here to a particular class of non-Gaussian primordial\ndistributions, namely multiplicative models. In such models, strongly\ncorrelated phases are produced by obtaining the gravitational potential via a\nnonlinear local transformation of an underlying Gaussian random field. The\ndynamical evolution of the system is followed by describing the trajectories of\nfluid particles using second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory. In the\nEinstein-de Sitter universe, the lowest-order perturbative correction to the\nvariance of the linear angular momentum of collapsing structures grows as t^8/3\nfor generic non-Gaussian statistics, which contrasts with the t^10/3 growth\nrate characteristic of Gaussian statistics. This is a consequence of the fact\nthat the lowest-order perturbative spin contribution in the non-Gaussian case\narises from the third moment of the gravitational potential, which is\nidentically zero for a Gaussian field. Evaluating these corrections at the\nmaximum expansion time of the collapsing structure, we find that these\nnon-Gaussian and non-linear terms can be as high as the linear estimate,\nwithout the degree of non-Gaussianity as quantified by skewness and kurtosis of\nthe density field being unacceptably large. The results suggest that\nhigher-order terms in the perturbative expansion may contribute significantly\nto galactic spin which contrasts with the straightforward Gaussian case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 1997 11:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Our approach is\nbased on centre manifold reduction for maps, and is in the spirit of earlier\nwork by Iooss (1986) on bifurcations of group orbits of spatially symmetric\nequilibria. Two examples, two-dimensional pulsating waves (PW) and\nthree-dimensional alternating pulsating waves (APW), have discrete\nspatio-temporal symmetries characterized by the cyclic groups Z_n, n=2 (PW) and\nn=4 (APW). These symmetries force the Poincare return map M to be the nth\niterate of a map G: M=G^n. The group orbits of PW and APW are generated by\ntranslations in the horizontal directions and correspond to a circle and a\ntwo-torus, respectively. An instability of pulsating waves can lead to\nsolutions that drift along the group orbit, while bifurcations with Floquet\nmultiplier +1 of alternating pulsating waves do not lead to drifting solutions.\nThe third example we consider, alternating rolls, has the spatio-temporal\nsymmetry of alternating pulsating waves as well as being invariant under\nreflections in two vertical planes. When the bifurcation breaks these\nreflections, the map G has a \"two-symmetry\", as analysed by Lamb (1996). This\nleads to a doubling of the marginal Floquet multiplier and the possibility of\nbifurcation to two distinct types of drifting solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 1997 15:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
