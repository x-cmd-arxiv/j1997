The\noptical light curve is strongly correlated with the UV spectrophotometric flux\ncurve. An emission-like feature near 1820 A in the UV spectrum is likely to be\na manifestation of the ``Fe II curtain.'' Composite spectra constructed from\nthe peaks and troughs of flickers in the light curve show substantial\ndifferences. The spectrum of the flickers is not adequately modelled by a\nsimple blackbody, suggesting that a more sophisticated model is appropriate. We\nperform a cross-correlation analysis of the variability in spectrophotometric\nflux curves of the UV continuum and prominent UV emission lines (C II 1335, Si\nIV 1400, C IV 1550). The continuum and lines are not correlated, suggesting\nthat they are produced separately.

A similar strong asymmetry appears also in the recently\ndiscovered, masing, circumnuclear disks in NGC 1068 and NGC 4945, thus\nsuggesting it may be a general phenomenon.\n  We show that the observed Doppler-shift asymmetry can naturally arise due to\nspiral shocks in circumnuclear disks, independent of the existence of a warp in\nthe disk or the azimuthal direction to the observer. The high velocities of\nthese features reflect the rotational velocities in the disk, and have nothing\nto do with the shock speed. In NGC 4258 - the currently most well-defined\nmasing disk - the proposed scenario can also account for the intriguing\nclustering of the high-velocity maser spots in distinct clumps, the restricted\nspatial distribution of the low-velocity sources, and the dip in the maser\nspectrum at the systemic velocity of the disk. In this case we infer a disk\nmass of ~10E4 M_sun and a mass accretion rate of order ~7E-3 M_sun/year, which\nmay be consistent with an advection-dominated accretion flow. The model is\nconsistent with the observed Keplerian rotation, and introduces only negligible\ncorrections to the previously derived black hole mass and galaxy distance.\n  Predictions include slow systematic drifts in the velocity and position of\nall the high-velocity features, and the existence of circumnuclear disks which\nare delineated only by high-velocity maser emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 1997 21:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
