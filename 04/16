It is assumed that the plasma\nbeam is initially homogeneous and impacts with the Lorentz factor $\\Gamma_0\\gg\n1$ on the barrier. The magnetic field of the barrier $B_0$ is uniform and\ntransverse to the beam velocity. When the energy densities of the beam and the\nmagnetic field are comparable, $\\alpha = 8\\pi n_0m_pc^2(\\Gamma_0-1)/B^2_0\\sim\n1$, the process of the beam -- barrier interaction is strongly nonstationary,\nand the density of reversed protons is modulated in space by a factor of 10 or\nso. The modulation of reversed protons decreases with decrease of $\\alpha$. The\nbeam is found to penetrate deep into the barrier provided that $\\alpha >\n\\alpha_{cr}$, where $\\alpha_{cr}$ is about 0.4. The speed of such a penetration\nis subrelativistic and depends on $\\alpha$.

This is an overlapping spiral galaxy pair in which NGC\n2207 partially occults IC 2163. This geometry enables us to directly measure\nthe extinction of light from the background galaxy as it passes through the\ndisk of the foreground galaxy.

This deviation is significantly\nlarger in the interarm region than in the spiral arm. The extinction curve in\nthe spiral arm resembles a Milky Way $R_V=5.0$ dust model and the interarm\nextinction curve is flatter (``greyer'') still.

When fit to the data, both models suggest that the observed\ndifference between the arm and interarm extinction curves is caused by the\ninterarm region of NGC 2207 having a higher degree of dust patchiness (density\nratio between high-density and low-density phases) than the spiral arm region.\nWe note that an unresolved patchy dust distribution will cause us to\nunderestimate the average column depth of gas in a galaxy if based solely on\nthe visual extinction.
