The initial radial velocity of the inner\nmaterial was lower than the bulk of the ejecta, and formed a bubble of slow\nmaterial that started expanding again due to heating by the young pulsar's\nspindown energy. The expansion is mainly in one direction, and to explain this\nwe speculate that the pre-supernova system was a binary. The explosion caused\nthe binary to unbind, and the pulsar's former companion carved a lower-density\nchannel into the main ejecta. The resulting puncture of the bubble's edge\ngreatly facilitated expansion along its path relative to other directions. If\nthis is the case, we can estimate the current speed of the former binary\ncompanion and from this reconstruct the presupernova binary orbit. It follows\nthat the exploding star was a helium star, hence that the supernova was of type\nIb. Since the most likely binary companion is another neutron star, the\nevolution of the Vela remnant and its surroundings has been rather more\ncomplicated than the simple expansion of one supernova blast wave into\nunperturbed interstellar material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 1997 10:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

We\nconfirm the previously observed recurrent patterns of behaviour in the X-ray\ncolour-colour and hardness-intensity diagrams (HIDs) consisting of shifts and\nshape changes in the Z track. The source behaviour is correlated with overall\nintensity. When the overall intensity increases, the mean velocity of the\nmotion along the normal branch (NB) of the Z track increase, as well as the\nwidth of the NB in the HID. Contrary to previous results we find that, during\ndifferent observations, when the source is at the same position in the NB of\nthe Z track the rapid X-ray variability differs significantly. During the\nKuulkers et al. (1996) ``medium'' level, a normal branch quasi-periodic\noscillation (QPO) is detected, which is not seen during the ``high'' overall\nintensity level. During the high overall intensity level episodes the very-low\nfrequency noise on the lower NB is very strong, whereas during the medium\noverall intensity level episodes this noise component at the same position in\nthe Z track is much weaker. The explanation of the different overall intensity\nlevels with a precessing accretion disk is difficult to reconcile with our\ndata.
