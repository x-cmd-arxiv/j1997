Further optical observations were gathered\nthroughout most of 1994. The radio, millimeter, and near-infrared data show no\nstrong correlations with the higher energies. The optical light curves exhibit\nflickering of 0.2-0.3 mag on timescales of 1-2 days, superimposed on longer\ntimescale variations. Rapid variations of ~0.01 mag/min, which, if real, are\nthe fastest seen to date for any BL Lac object. Small (0.2-0.3 mag) increases\nin the V and R bands occur simultaneously with a flare seen at higher energies.\nAll optical wavebands (UBVRI) track each other well over the period of\nobservation with no detectable delay. For most of the period the average colors\nremain relatively constant, although there is a tendency for the colors (in\nparticular B-V) to vary more when the source fades. In polarized light, PKS\n2155-304 showed strong color dependence and the highest optical polarization (U\n= 14.3%) ever observed for this source. The polarization variations trace the\nflares seen in the ultraviolet flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Apr 1997 16:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The\nstabilization equations for $Z_m$ are also very simple and determine the size\nof the infinite $adS_3$-throat of the string. The black hole potential in\ngeneral exhibits two classes of critical points: supersymmetric critical points\nwhich coincide with those of the central charge and non-supersymmetric critical\npoints. We then generalize the discussion to the entire extended K\\\"ahler cone\nencompassing topologically different but birationally equivalent Calabi-Yau\nthree-folds that are connected via flop transitions. We examine behavior of the\nfour potentials to probe the nature of these phase transitions. We find that\n$V$ and $P$ are continuous but not smooth across the flop transition, while $Z$\nand its first two derivatives, as well as $Z_m$ and its first derivative, are\ncontinuous. This in turn implies that supersymmetric stabilization of $Z$ and\n$Z_m$ for a given configuration takes place in at most one point throughout the\nentire extended K\\\"ahler cone.
