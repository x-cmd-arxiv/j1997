A large body of observations in different bands suggests that the SEDs\nof BL Lac objects appearing in X-ray surveys differ from those appearing in\nradio surveys mainly in having a (synchrotron) spectral cut-off (or break) at\nmuch higher frequency. In order to explain the different properties of radio\nand X-ray selected BL Lacs Giommi and Padovani proposed a model based on a\ncommon radio luminosity function. At each radio luminosity, objects with high\nfrequency spectral cut-offs are assumed to be a minority. Nevertheless they\ndominate the X-ray selected population due to the larger X-ray-to-radio-flux\nratio. An alternative model explored here (reminiscent of the orientation\nmodels previously proposed) is that the X-ray luminosity function is \"primary\"\nand that at each X-ray luminosity a minority of objects has larger\nradio-to-X-ray flux ratio. The predictions of the two scenarios, computed via a\nMontecarlo technique, are compared with the observed properties of BL Lacs in\nthe two samples extracted respectively from the 1 Jy radio survey and the\nEinstein Slew Survey. We show that both models can explain a number but not all\nthe observed features.
