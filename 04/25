To develop an interpretation of\nthis brightness-dependent anisotropy, we consider GRBs distributed in a thick\ndisk centered on the Galaxy. As an approximation to the true luminosity\ndistribution, we divide bursts into two distinct luminosity classes. Most\nbursts originate from low-luminosity, nearby sources while the relatively few\nhigh-luminosity sources trace the shape of the thick disk. We find that\ncharacteristic disk dimensions as small as 20 kpc in thickness and 30 kpc in\nradial extent can match the observed brightness-dependent anisotropy as well as\nthe number-flux distribution; these dimensions are smaller than previously\nconsidered viable.

The\nformalism provides consistent dynamical descriptions of pi-N --> pi-N\nscattering and Gamma-N --> pi-N production mechanisms in terms of nonlinear\nintegral equations for fully dressed hadrons. Defining electromagnetic currents\nvia the gauging of hadronic n-point Green's functions, dynamically detailed\ncurrents for dressed nucleons are introduced. The dressed hadron currents and\nthe pion photoproduction current are explicitly shown to satisfy gauge\ninvariance in a self-consistent manner. Approximations are discussed that make\nthe nonlinear formalism manageable in practice and yet preserve gauge\ninvariance. This is achieved by recasting the gauge conditions for all\ncontributing interaction currents as continuity equations with ``surface''\nterms for the individual particle legs coming into or going out of the hadronic\ninteraction region. General procedures are given that approximate any type of\n(global) interaction current in a gauge-invariance preserving manner as a sum\nof single-particle ``surface'' currents. It is argued that these prescriptions\ncarry over to other reactions, irrespective of the number or type of\ncontributing hadrons or hadronic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 1997 17:53:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 1997 19:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
