We propose that this\nphenomenon is the result of sudden dynamical changes in the accretion disks\ntriggered by a gradual variation of mass accretion rates. These sudden torque\nreversals may occur at a critical accretion rate $\\sim$\n$10^{15}-10^{16}g~s^{-1}$ when the system makes a transition from (to) a\nprimarily Keplerian flow to (from) a substantially sub-Keplerian, radial\nadvective flow in the inner disk. For systems near spin equilibrium, the\nspin-up torques in the Keplerian state are slightly larger than the spin-down\ntorques in the advective state, in agreement with observation. The abrupt\nreversals could be a signature of pulsar systems near spin equilibrium with the\nmass accretion rates modulated on a time scale of a year or longer near the\ncritical accretion rate. It is interesting that cataclysmic variables and black\nhole soft X-ray transients change their X-ray emission properties at accretion\nrates similar to the pulsars' critical rate.
