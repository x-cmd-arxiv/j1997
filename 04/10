We show that the proposed new formalism\npermits the apparently first exact representation of the total magnetic moments\nof new-body nuclei under conventional physical laws. We then point out that, if\nexperimentally confirmed the alterability of the intrinsic characteristics of\nnucleons would imply new forms of recycling nuclear waste by the nuclear power\nplants in their own site, thus avoiding its transportation and storage in a\n(yet unidentified) dumping area. A number of possible, additional basic\nadvances are also indicated, such as: new un- derstanding of nuclear forces\nwith nowel nonlinear, nonlocal and nonunitary terms due to mutual penetrations\nof the hyperdense nucleons; consequential new models of nuclear structures; new\nmagnetic confinement of the controlled fusion taking into account the possible\nalterability of the intrinsic magnetic moments of nucleons at the initiation of\nthe fusion process; new sources of en- ergy based on subnuclear processes; and\nother possible advances.

We present several different\nefficient schemes for constructing families of such codes.

In general, we show that it\nis possible to build quantum burst-correcting codes that have near optimal\ndimension.

Obviously,\none has to impose on the hypothetical alternative theory precise physical\nrequirements. We analyse various such constraints and we show step by step how\nto meet them. This way of attacking the problem allows to recall and focus on\nsome relevant features of Bohm's theory. One of the central requirements we\nimpose on the models we are going to analyse has to do with their\ntransformation properties under the transformations of the extended Galilei\ngroup. In a context like the one we are interested in one can put forward\nvarious requests that we refer to as physical and genuine covariance and\ninvariance. Other fundamental requests are that the theory allows the\ndescription of isolated physical systems as well as that it leads to a solution\n(in the same sense as Bohmian Mechanics) of the measurement problem.
