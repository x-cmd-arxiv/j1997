This permits an analytic solution\nfor the case of a relativistic plasmoid with a constant internal magnetic\nfield.

The size function of\ndisk scale lengths in disk-dominated galaxies is found to stay roughly constant\nto z=1. This result, which is strengthened by inclusion of the local de Jong et\nal (1996) size function, suggests that the scale lengths of typical disks can\nnot have grown substantially with cosmic epoch since z=1, unless a\ncorresponding number of large disks have been destroyed through merging. In\naddition to a roughly constant number density, the galaxies with large disks\nhave, as a set, properties consistent with the idea that they are similar\ngalaxies observed at different cosmic epochs. However, on average, they show\nhigher B-band disk surface brightnesses, bluer overall (U-V) colors, higher\n[OII] 3727 equivalent widths and less regular morphologies at high redshift\nthan at low redshift, suggesting an increase in the star-formation rate by a\nfactor of about 3 to z=0.7.
