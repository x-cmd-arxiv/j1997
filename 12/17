For comparison with the PSCz data we also examine the genus of large\nN-body simulations of four variants of the cold dark matter cosmogony. The\nsimulations are part of the Virgo project to simulate the formation of\nstructure in the Universe. We assume that the statistical properties of the\ngalaxy distribution can be identified with those of the dark matter particles\nin the simulations. We extend the standard genus analysis by examining the\ninfluence of sampling noise on the genus curve and introducing a statistic able\nto quantify the amount of phase correlation present in the density field, the\n\"amplitude drop\" of the genus compared to a Gaussian field with identical power\nspectrum. The results for PSCz are consistent with the hypothesis of\nrandom-phase initial conditions. In particular, no strong phase correlation is\ndetected on scales ranging from 10 h^(-1)Mpc to 32 h^(-1)Mpc, whereas there is\na positive detection of phase correlation at smaller scales. Among the\nsimulations, phase correlations are detected in all models at small scales,\nalbeit with different strengths. when scaled to a common normalization, the\namplitude drop primarily depends on the shape of the power spectrum. We find\nthat the constant bias standard CDM model can be ruled out at high significance\nbecause the shape of its power spectrum is not consistent with PSCz. The other\nCDM models with more large-scale power all fit the PSCz data almost equally\nwell, with a slight preference for a high-density tauCDM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 1997 15:08:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Dec 1997 14:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
