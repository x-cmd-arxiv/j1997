These images allow\nus to distinguish several morphological components: (1) an unresolved nuclear\npoint source (<=500 pc at z=2.390 for Ho=75, qo=0), likely the central AGN\nwhich contains <=20-25% of the total light in BVI; (2) a compact continuum core\n(re~0.05\"); (3) a more extended envelope with an r^1/4-like light-profile and\nre~0.25\" (~2 kpc); (4) two blue ''clouds'' roughly colinear across the nucleus\naligned with the radio source axis and contained well within the size of the\nradio source. (B-I) color maps may suggest a narrow dust lane crossing between\nthe nucleus and the smaller blue cloud. The radio source is not smaller than\nthe distance between the blue continuum clouds, and coincides with a bright Lya\n''arc'' in the western cloud, suggesting that jet-induced star-formation could\ncause both blue clouds, except the outer parts of the western cloud. The shape\nof this larger blue cloud suggests reflected AGN continuum-light shining\nthrough a cone (plus re-radiated Lya in emission). The OVRO interferometric\nCO-detection (Scoville et al. 1997) on both sides of 53W002 - and in the same\ndirection as the continuum clouds and the radio jet - also suggest a\nstar-bursting region induced by its radio jet, at least in the inner parts.\nEven at radio powers ~1.5 dex fainter than the 3CR sources, we thus find many\nof the same aligned features and complex morphology, although at much smaller\nangular scales and lower optical-UV luminosities.
