Two cases are considered: (i) a\nbinary star; and (ii) a solitary star with the planetary companion. It is shown\nthat, in case (i), several precision Doppler measurements employing the gas\nabsorption cell technique would determine both the total orbital velocity and\nthe inclination angle of the binary orbit disentangled from the peculiar\nvelocity of the system.

Lorentz symmetry can be broken at Planck scale due to the\nrenormalization of gravity or to some deeper structure of matter: we expect\nsuch a breaking to be a very high energy and very short distance phenomenon. If\ntextbook special relativity is only an approximate property of the equations\ndescribing a sector of matter above some critical distance scale, an absolute\nlocal frame (the \"vacuum rest frame\", VRF) can possibly be found and\nsuperluminal sectors of matter may exist related to new degrees of freedom not\nyet discovered experimentally. The new superluminal particles (\"superbradyons\",\ni.e. bradyons with superluminal critical speed) would have positive mass and\nenergy, and behave kinematically like \"ordinary\" particles (those with critical\nspeed in vacuum equal to c, the speed of light) apart from the difference in\ncritical speed (c_i >> c where c_i is the critical speed of a superluminal\nsector). They may be the ultimate building blocks of matter At speed v > c,\nthey are expected to release \"Cherenkov\" radiation (\"ordinary\" particles) in\nvacuum. Superluminal particles could provide most of the cosmic (dark) matter\nand produce very high-energy cosmic rays. We discuss: a) the possible relevance\nof superluminal matter to the composition, sources and spectra of high-energy\ncosmic rays; b) signatures and experiments allowing to possibly explore such\neffects. Very large volume and unprecedented background rejection ability are\ncrucial requirements for any detector devoted to the search for cosmic\nsuperbradyons. Future cosmic-ray experiments using air-shower detectors\n(especially from space) naturally fulfil both requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Dec 1997 15:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
