First,\nthe coupling constant is restricted to a set $I$ which need not be an interval\nbut 0 is still a point of density of $I$. Second, the Rayleigh-Schrodinger\nseries are asymptotic to the perturbed eigen-value and the perturbed\neigen-vector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 1997 19:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-06"}

The usefulness of a quantum com puter is limited by the effect of errors.\nSimulation is a useful tool for determining the feasibility of quantum\ncomputers in the presence of errors. The size of a quantum computer that can be\nsimulat ed is small because faithfully modeling a quantum computer requires an\nexponential amount of storage and number of operations. In this paper we define\nsimulation models to study the feasibility of quantum computers. The most\ndetailed of these models is based directly on a proposed imple mentation. We\nalso define less detailed models which are exponentially less complex but still\npro duce accurate results. Finally we show that the two different types of\nerrors, decoherence and inaccuracies, are uncorrelated. This decreases the\nnumber of simulations which must be per formed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 1997 03:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
