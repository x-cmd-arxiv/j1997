The corresponding nuclear matrix\nelements are calculated within the renormalized quasiparticle random phase\napproximation, which includes the Pauli effect of fermion pairs and does not\ncollapse for the physical values of the nuclear force strength. On this basis\nwe extract from the experimental data new stringent limits on the 1st\ngeneration mass parameter characterized the lepton-Higgs bilinear coupling and\non the electron sneutrino vacuum expectation value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 1997 12:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
