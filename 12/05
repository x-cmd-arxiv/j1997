We investigate this\nhypothesis in the light of formation times defined as the epoch at which halos\nexperience their last major merger. Such halo formation times are calculated by\nmeans of a modification of the extended Press & Schechter formalism which\nincludes a phenomenological frontier, Delta_m, between tiny and notable\nrelative mass captures leading to the distinction between merger and accretion.\nFor Delta_m=0.6, we confirm that the characteristic density of halos is\nessentially proportional to the mean density of the universe at their time of\nformation.

In addition, we find that the scale\nradius of halos is also essentially proportional to their virial radius at the\ntime of formation.\n  We show that these two relations are consistent with the following simple\nscenario. Violent relaxation caused by mergers rearranges the structure of\nhalos leading to the same density profile with universal values of the\ndimensionless characteristic density and scale radius.

The object was imaged on 1997 June 2\nwith the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and Near-Infrared Camera and\nMulti-Object Spectrometer. The observations reveal a point-like source with R =\n23.1 +- 0.2 and H = 20.6 +- 0.3, in agreement with the power-law temporal decay\nseen in previous ground-based monitoring. Unlike the case of GRB970228, no\nnebulosity is detected surrounding the OT of GRB970508, although Mg I\nabsorption and [O II] emission seen in Keck spectra at a redshift of z = 0.835\nsuggest the presence of a dense, star-forming medium. The HST observations set\nvery conservative upper limits of R ~24.5 and H ~22.2 on the brightness of any\nunderlying extended source. If this subtends a substantial fraction of an\narcsecond, then the R band limit is ~25.5. Subsequent photometry suggests a\nflattening of the light curve at later epochs. Assuming the OT decline follows\na pure power-law and ascribing the flattening to the presence of an underlying\ncomponent of constant flux, we find that this must have R = 25.4, consistent\nwith the upper limits determined by HST. At z = 0.8, this would correspond to\nan absolute magnitude in the U band of ~-18, similar to that of the Large\nMagellanic Cloud. We propose a scenario in which the host galaxy of the GRB is\nof Magellanic type, possibly being a ``satellite'' of one of the bright\ngalaxies located at few arcseconds from the optical transient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 1997 11:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
