The spectrum is flat (Gamma = 1.5) with a\nsubstantial absorption Nh = 10^22 cm^-2 and does not require any reflection\ncomponent.

The quantum cumulants are then expanded by traces which, in\nturn, split into quantum itineraries or cycles. These can be organized by a\nsimple symbolic dynamics. The semiclassical reduction of the coherent\nmultiscattering part takes place on the level of the quantum cycles. We show\nthat the semiclassical analog of the m-th quantum cumulant is the m-th\ncurvature term of the semiclassical zeta function.

The problem is particularly relevant for viscous liquids, where the\ninteresting time-scales are often beyond those reachable by computer\nsimulation. An approximate formula is derived which reduces the calculation of\nthe time auto- correlation function to a \"double canonical\" average. In this\napproximation, in the case of Langevin dynamics the mean-square displacement\nitself may be evaluated from the \"double partition function\" . The scheme\ndeveloped is illustrated by computer simulations of a simple one-dimensional\nsystem at different temperatures, showing good agreement between the exact time\nauto-correlation functions and those found by the approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 1997 14:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
