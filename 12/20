Our investigation is based on\nthe discrete analogue of the theory of the rectilinear congruences, which we\nalso present in detail. We study, in particular, the discrete analogues of the\nLaplace, Combescure, Levy, radial and fundamental transformations and their\ninterrelations. The composition of these transformations and their\npermutability is also investigated from a geometric point of view. The deep\nconnections between \"transformations\" and \"discretizations\" is also\ninvestigated for quadrilateral lattices. We finally interpret these results\nwithin the D-bar formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Dec 1997 11:02:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Jan 1998 13:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
