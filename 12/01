We analyze and characterize plateaus\nfor three different classes of randomly generated Boolean Satisfiability\nproblems. We identify several interesting features of plateaus that impact the\nperformance of local search algorithms. We show that local minima tend to be\nsmall but occasionally may be very large. We also show that local minima can be\nescaped without unsatisfying a large number of clauses, but that systematically\nsearching for an escape route may be computationally expensive if the local\nminimum is large. We show that plateaus with exits, called benches, tend to be\nmuch larger than minima, and that some benches have very few exit states which\nlocal search can use to escape. We show that the solutions (i.e., global\nminima) of randomly generated problem instances form clusters, which behave\nsimilarly to local minima. We revisit several enhancements of local search\nalgorithms and explain their performance in light of our results. Finally we\ndiscuss strategies for creating the next generation of local search algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 1997 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

For quite a long\ntime, this search strategy did not achieve the expected results, and there was\na major misunderstanding about the reasons behind it. Although there is still\nwide-spread belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the\nproblem of search frontiers passing each other, we demonstrate that this\nconjecture is wrong. Based on this finding, we present both a new generic\napproach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically\nimproving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These\napproaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently\nproposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding.\nEmpirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that\nbidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with\nlimited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search\nappears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding\nunidirectional search. This provides some evidence for the usefulness of a\nsearch strategy that was long neglected. In summary, we show that bidirectional\nheuristic search is viable and consequently propose that it be reconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 1997 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
