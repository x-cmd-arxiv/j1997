The instantaneous\nFRC however departs form a simple square-root law. The distortion is maximum\naround one year, and reflects the market anticipation of a local trend on the\nspot rate. This anticipated trend is shown to be calibrated on the past\nbehaviour of the spot itself.

Finally, the number of independent components needed to interpret\nmost of the FRC fluctuations is found to be small. We rationalize this by\nshowing that the dynamical evolution of the FRC contains a stabilizing second\nderivative (line tension) term, which tends to suppress short scale distortions\nof the FRC. This shape dependent term could lead, in principle, to arbitrage.\nHowever, this arbitrage cannot be implemented in practice because of\ntransaction costs.

We compare\nthe zero-bias,zero-temperature 4-probe conductances $G_{N}$ and $G_{S}$ of a\nnormal diffusive metal in contact with a superconductor in both the normal (N)\nand superconducting (S) states respectively. In the absence of tunnel barriers,\nthe ensemble average of the difference $\\delta G=G_{S}-G_N$ vanishes, in\nagreement with quasi-classical theory.

A major theme here is\n``preservation by iteration'', but we also show a dichotomy: if such forcing\nnotions preserve the positiveness of the set of old reals for some naturally\ndefine c.c.c. ideals, then they preserve the positiveness of any old positive\nset. We also prove that (among such forcing notions) the only one commuting\nwith Cohen is Cohen itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 1997 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}
