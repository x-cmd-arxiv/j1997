The size and homogeneity of this data set allows us to\nsample, for the first time, the entire range of galactic environment, from the\nvoids to the clusters, in a uniform manner, thus, we could decouple the local\ngalaxy density from the membership in associations. This decoupling is very\ncrucial for constraining the physical processes responsible for the\nenvironmental dependencies of SFR.

We find that cluster galaxies exhibit lower SFR for the same C\nthan field galaxies, while a further division of clusters by `richness' reveals\na new possible excitation of `starbursts' in poor clusters.

Recent\nobservational results on the galactocentric cosmic-ray density gradient and\nvery high gamma-ray emission do not support expectations from the simplest\nmodels with a Galactic origin of cosmic rays. The hypothesis that ``flux\ntrapping'' of extragalactical cosmic rays occurs in the Galactic confinement\nvolume is advanced. Taking this phenomenon into account, I explicitely discuss\nhow previous objections against an extragalactic origin of hadronic cosmic rays\nloose their strength. The local energy density of hadronic cosmic rays and\nother observational facts can be understood in a very natural way assuming an\nextragalactical origin. A promising scenario seems to be a Galactic origin of\nelectrons and an extragalactic origin of hadrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 1997 11:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Rather than finding the\nbest word interpretation for an acoustic signal, we redefine the speech\nrecognition problem to so that it also identifies the POS tags, discourse\nmarkers, speech repairs and intonational phrase endings (a major cue in\ndetermining utterance units). Adding these extra elements to the speech\nrecognition problem actually allows it to better predict the words involved,\nsince we are able to make use of the predictions of boundary tones, discourse\nmarkers and speech repairs to better account for what word will occur next.\nFurthermore, we can take advantage of acoustic information, such as silence\ninformation, which tends to co-occur with speech repairs and intonational\nphrase endings, that current language models can only regard as noise in the\nacoustic signal. The output of this language model is a much fuller account of\nthe speaker's turn, with part-of-speech assigned to each word, intonation\nphrase endings and discourse markers identified, and speech repairs detected\nand corrected. In fact, the identification of the intonational phrase endings,\ndiscourse markers, and resolution of the speech repairs allows the speech\nrecognizer to model the speaker's utterances, rather than simply the words\ninvolved, and thus it can return a more meaningful analysis of the speaker's\nturn for later processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 1997 23:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
