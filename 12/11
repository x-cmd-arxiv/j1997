The angular velocity deviates from the Keplerian\nvalue as a result of the radial Lorentz force, but is constant on magnetic\nsurfaces. Angular momentum transport and energy dissipation in the disk are\nparametrized by an alpha-prescription, and a Kramers opacity law is assumed to\nhold. We also determine the stability of the equilibria with respect to the\nmagnetorotational (or Balbus-Hawley) instability. If the magnetic field is\nsufficiently strong, stable equilibria can be found in which the angle of\ninclination, i, of the magnetic field to the vertical at the surface of the\ndisk has any value in the range [0,90 degrees). By analyzing the dynamics of a\ntransonic outflow in the corona of the disk, we show that a certain potential\ndifference must be overcome even when i > 30 degrees. We determine this\npotential difference as a function of i for increasing values of the vertical\nmagnetic field strength. For magnetorotationally stable equilibria, the\npotential difference increases faster than the fourth power of the magnetic\nfield strength, quickly exceeding a value corresponding to the central\ntemperature of the disk, and is minimized with respect to i at i approximately\nequal to 38 degrees.

In particular, consider what happens when one allows the ten-form\nfield strength $F_{10}$ to vary discontinuously across the worldvolume of the\nbrane. Since the ten-form is constant on each side of the brane ($d*F_{10} =\n0$), a variation in the bulk term $\\int F_{10}*F_{10}$ gives rise to a net\npressure acting on the surface of the brane. This means that the infinite\n`planar' eight-brane is no longer a static configuration with these boundary\nconditions. Instead, a static configuration is found only when the brane\n`compactifies' to the topology of an eight-sphere, $S^8$. These spherical\neight-branes are thus bubbles which form boundaries between different phases of\nthe massive Type IIA supergravity theory. While these bubbles are generically\nunstable and will want to expand (or contract), we show that in certain cases\nthere is a critical radius, $r_c$, at which the (inward) tension of the brane\nis exactly counterbalanced by the (outward) force exerted by the pressure\nterms. Intuitively, these `compactified' branes are just spherical bubbles\nwhere the effective cosmological constant jumps by a discrete amount as you\ncross a brane worldsheet. We argue that these branes will be unstable to\nvarious semi-classical decay processes. We discuss the implications of such\nprocesses for the open strings which have endpoints on the eight-brane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 1997 09:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, a basic flaw in\nthe protocol was discovered by Mayers in 1995 and subsequently by Lo and Chau.\nLater the result was generalized by Mayers who showed that unconditionally\nsecure bit commitment is impossible. A brief review on quantum bit commitment\nwhich focuses on the general impossibility theorem and on recent attempts to\nbypass this result is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 1997 20:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
