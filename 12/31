Inflation seems like a\nvery promising answer, but as Borde and Vilenkin have shown, the inflationary\nstate preceding the Big Bang must have had a beginning also. Ultimately, the\ndifficult question seems to be how to make something out of nothing. This paper\nexplores the idea that this is the wrong question --- that that is not how the\nUniverse got here. Instead, we explore the idea of whether there is anything in\nthe laws of physics that would prevent the Universe from creating itself.\nBecause spacetimes can be curved and multiply connected, general relativity\nallows for the possibility of closed timelike curves (CTCs). Thus, tracing\nbackwards in time through the original inflationary state we may eventually\nencounter a region of CTCs giving no first-cause. This region of CTCs, may well\nbe over by now (being bounded toward the future by a Cauchy horizon). We\nillustrate that such models --- with CTCs --- are not necessarily inconsistent\nby demonstrating self-consistent vacuums for Misner space and a multiply\nconnected de Sitter space in which the renormalized energy-momentum tensor does\nnot diverge as one approaches the Cauchy horizon and solves Einstein's\nequations. We show such a Universe can be classically stable and\nself-consistent if and only if the potentials are retarded, giving a natural\nexplanation of the arrow of time. Some specific scenarios (out of many possible\nones) for this type of model are described. For example: an inflationary\nuniverse gives rise to baby universes, one of which turns out to be itself.\nInterestingly, the laws of physics may allow the Universe to be its own mother.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 1997 17:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}
