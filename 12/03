The bulk Lorentz factor decreases and radiation is beamed\ninto an ever increasing solid angle as the burst remnant expands. It follows\nthat if gamma ray bursts are highly collimated, many more optical and radio\ntransients should be observed without associated gamma rays than with them.\n  In addition, a burst whose ejecta are beamed into angle zeta undergoes a\nqualitative change in evolution when Gamma < 1/zeta: Before this, Gamma ~\nr^{-3/2}, while afterwards, Gamma decays exponentially with r. This change\nresults in a potentially observable break in the afterglow light curve.\n  Successful application of either test would eliminate the largest remaining\nuncertainty in the energy requirements and space density of gamma ray bursters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 1997 15:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The philosophical and physical foundations of general relativity are\nbriefly reviewed. The Ehlers-Pirani-Schild scheme of operationally determining\nthe geometry of space-time, using freely falling classical particle\ntrajectories, is done using operations in an infinitesimal neighborhood around\neach point. The study of the free fall of a quantum wave suggests a quantum\nprinciple of equivalence. The principle of general covariance is clarified. The\nsign change of a Fermion field when rotated by $2\\pi$ radians is used to argue\nfor a quantum mechanical modification of space-time, which leads naturally to\nsupersymmetry. A novel effect in quantum gravity due to the author is used to\nextend Einstein's hole argument to quantum gravity. This suggests a quantum\nprinciple of general covariance, according to which the fundamental laws of\nphysics should be covariant under `quantum diffeomorphisms'. This heuristic\nprinciple implies that space-time points have no invariant meaning in quantum\ngravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 1997 21:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is shown that for excitation energy 3 to 8\nMeV/nucleon, the temperature remains constant in the range 5 to 6 MeV, which is\nclose to experiment. The mechanism of energy deposition through the\ntripartition of colliding system envisaged in this model together with\ninter-fragment nuclear interaction are found to play important role. A possible\nsignature of liquid-gas phase transition is seen in the specific heat\ndistribution calculated from these caloric curves, and the critical temperature\nis found to be $\\sim$ 6 to 6.5 MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 1997 17:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Let $\\frak u_\\ell$ be the small quantum group a the primitive $\\ell$-th\nroot of unity. Then it is known that the usual $Ext$ algebra of the trivial\n$\\frak u_\\ell$-module is isomorphic to the algebra of regular functions on the\nnilpotent variety $\\cal N$ in the corresponding simple Lie algebra $\\frak g$\n(see [GK]). Consider semiinfinite cohomology of the trivial $\\frak\nu_\\ell$-module introduced in [Ar1], [Ar2]. It was shown in [Ar2] that the $Ext$\nalgebra of the trivial $\\frak u_\\ell$-module acts naturally on semiinfinite\ncohomology. Moreover semiinfinite cohomology space of the trivial\n$\\frak_\\ell$-module is equipped with a natural $\\frak g$-module structure. B.\nFeigin conjectured that the described $\\frak g$-module and $F(\\cal N)$-module\nstructures coincide with the ones on the space of local cohomology of the\nstructure sheaf on $\\cal N$ with support in the standard positive nilpotent\nsubalgebra $\\frak n^+\\subset\\cal N\\subset \\frak g$. We give a detailed proof of\nthe conjecture. Moreover we generalize the statement and describe semiinfinite\ncohomology of contragradient Weyl modules in terms of local cohomology of\ncertain coherent sheaves on the nilpotent cone and on its desingularization\n$T^*(G/B)$. To do this we construct a certain specialization of the quantum BGG\nresolution of the simple module $L(\\lambda)$ defined for generic values of the\nquantizing parameter into the root of unity called the quasi-BGG complex. The\ncomplex conists of direct sums of quasi-Verma modules and provides\nconjecturally a resolution of the Weyl module $W(\\lambda)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 1997 17:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
