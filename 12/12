Such a\nconnection is unique, because it is Yang-Mills. We call the bundles admitting\nsuch connections hyperholomorphic bundles. A stable bundle is hyperholomorphic\nif and only if its Chern classes $c_1$, $c_2$ are SU(2)-invariant, with respect\nto the natural SU(2)-action on the cohomology. For several years, it was known\nthat the moduli space of stable hyperholomorphic bundles is singular\nhyperkaehler. More recently, it was proven that singular hyperkaehler varieties\nadmit a canonical hyperkaehler desingularization. In the present paper, we show\nthat a moduli space of stable hyperholomorphic bundles is compact, given some\nassumptions on Chern classes of B and hyperkaehler geometry of $M$ (we also\nrequire $dim_C M>2$). Conjecturally, this leads to new examples of hyperkaehler\nmanifolds. We develop the theory of hyperholomorphic sheaves, which are\n(intuitively speaking) coherent sheaves compatible with hyperkaehler structure.\nWe show that hyperholomorphic sheaves with isolated singularities can be\ncanonically desingularized by a blow-up. This theory is used to study\ndegenerations of hyperholomorphic bundles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 1997 19:58:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2012 22:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-11"}

The emission lines widths, FWHM ~ 1000-1500 km/s, and line ratios, along\nwith the compact morphology and high luminosity (M_B ~ -24.0) of the galaxy\nindicate that SMM 02399-0136 contains a rare dust-embedded, narrow-line or\ntype-2 AGN.

A possible cause for this is the formation of the disc,\nlater in the history of the galaxy, and this is simulated by applying on the\nN-body bulge the force field of a exponential disc whose surface density\nincreases with time. It is shown that [n], the index of the Sersic law that\nbest describes the surface brightness profile, does indeed decrease from 4 (de\nVaucouleurs law) to smaller values; this decrease is larger for more massive\nand more compact discs. A large part of the observed trend of [n] with B/D\nratio is explained, and many of the actual profiles can be matched exactly by\nthe simulations. The correlation between the disc scalelength and bulge\neffective radius, used recently to support the \"secular evolution\" origin for\nbulges, is also shown to arise naturally in a scenario like this. This\nmechanism, however, saturates at around n=2 and exponential bulges cannot be\nproduced; as [n] gets closer to 1, the profile becomes increasingly robust\nagainst a disc field. These results provide strong support to the old-bulge\nhypothesis for the early-type bulges. The exponential bulges, however, remain\nessentially unexplained; the results here suggest that they did not begin their\nlives as de Vaucouleurs spheroids, and hence were probably formed, at least in\npart, by different processes than those of early type spirals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 1997 02:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
