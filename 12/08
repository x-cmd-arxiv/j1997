The reduction is\nsupposed to depend on either the mean scalar field or the effective mass of the\nnucleon. It is shown that the electric and magnetic radii of the bound nucleon\nare almost linearly correlated with the bag constant. Using the fact that the\nsize of the bound nucleon inside a nucleus is strongly constrained by\n$y$-scaling data in quasielastic, electron-nucleus scattering, we set a limit\nfor the reduction allowed in the bag constant for these two models. The present\nstudy implies that the bag constant can decrease up to 10--17 % at average\nnuclear density, depending on the details of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 1997 11:31:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 1998 10:18:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-17"}

This method\nappears to be inapplicable, f.e., in the case of waves in Maxwellian\ncollisionless plasma when dispersion equation has no solutions. By means of\nsome refined sophistication L.~Landau in 1946 has suggested in this case\nactually to replace the dispersion equation with another one, having a specific\nsolution (``Landau damping'') and being now widely used in plasma physics.\nRecently we have suggested a quite new universal method of two-dimensional\nLaplace transformation (in coordinate $x$ and time $t$ for plane wave case),\nthat allows to obtain asymptotical solutions of original Vlasov plasma\nequations as inseparable sets of coupled oscillatory modes (but not a single\nwave like $\\exp(-i\\omega t+i k x)$). The mode parameters are defined in this\ncase by double-poles ($\\omega_n$,$k_n$) of Laplace image $E(\\omega_n,k_n)$ of\nelectrical field $E(x,t)$. This method allows one to obtain the whole set of\noscillatory modes for every concrete problem. It leads to some new ideology in\nthe theory of plasma oscillations, which are considered as a combination of\ncoupled oscillatory modes (characterized by pairs ($\\omega_n$,$k_n$) and\namplitudes) and depend not only on the intrinsic plasma parameters, but also on\nmutually dependent self-consistent initial and boundary conditions and on\nmethod of plasma oscillations excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 1997 11:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
