The frequency of the QPOs in the persistent flux is\ncorrelated with the mass accretion rate on time scale of hours, but not on time\nscale of days.

These regimes,\nwith a very similar energy spectrum and QPO frequency, are distinguished from\neach other by the mass accretion rate or the total X-ray flux. The NCOs during\nthe burst can be made almost perfectly coherent by taking into account a large\nfrequency derivative.

In the other, the central site sporadically releases energy\nover hundreds of seconds forming a peak with each burst of energy.

In fact, numerical\nsimulations show that different patterns are obtained when space and time steps\n($\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta t$) are varied independently. On the other hand,\nanisotropy effects due to the symmetries of the discretization lattice prevent\nthe quantitative calibration of models. We introduce a new class of explicit\ndifference methods for numerical integration of diffusion and\nreaction-diffusion equations, where the dependence on space and time scales\noccurs naturally. Numerical solutions approach the exact solution of the\ncontinuous diffusion equation for finite $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta t$, if the\nparameter $\\gamma_N=D \\Delta t/(\\Delta x)^2$ assumes a fixed constant value,\nwhere $N$ is an odd positive integer parametrizing the alghorithm. The error\nbetween the solutions of the discrete and the continuous equations goes to zero\nas $(\\Delta x)^{2(N+2)}$ and the values of $\\gamma_N$ are dimension\nindependent. With these new integration methods, anisotropy effects resulting\nfrom the finite differences are minimized, defining a standard for validation\nand calibration of numerical solutions of diffusion and reaction-diffusion\nequations. Comparison between numerical and analytical solutions of\nreaction-diffusion equations give global discretization errors of the order of\n$10^{-6}$ in the sup norm. Circular patterns of travelling waves have a maximum\nrelative random deviation from the spherical symmetry of the order of 0.2%, and\nthe standard deviation of the fluctuations around the mean circular wave front\nis of the order of $10^{-3}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 1997 11:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
