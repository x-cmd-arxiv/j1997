Theoretically calculated direct tunneling in\niron group systems leads to about a 30% change in resistance, which is close to\nexperimentally observed values. It is shown that the larger observed values of\nthe TMR might be a result of tunneling involving surface polarized states. We\nfind that tunneling via resonant defect states in the barrier radically\ndecreases the TMR (down to 4% with Fe-based electrodes), and a resonant tunnel\ndiode structure would give a TMR of about 8%. With regards to inelastic\ntunneling, magnons and phonons exhibit opposite effects: one-magnon emission\ngenerally results in spin mixing and, consequently, reduces the TMR, whereas\nphonons are shown to enhance the TMR. The inclusion of both magnons and phonons\nreasonably explains an unusual bias dependence of the TMR.\n  The model presented here is applied qualitatively to half-metallics with 100%\nspin polarization, where one-magnon processes are suppressed and the change in\nresistance in the absence of spin-mixing on impurities may be arbitrarily\nlarge. Even in the case of imperfect magnetic configurations, the resistance\nchange can be a few 1000 percent. Examples of half-metallic systems are\nCrO$_2$/TiO$_2$ and CrO$_2$/RuO$_2$, and an account of their peculiar band\nstructures is presented. The implications and relation of these systems to CMR\nmaterials which are nearly half-metallic, are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 1997 17:27:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 1997 01:16:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Elasticity of the solid leads to long range stress\ntransfer along the crack front which is non-monotonic in time due to the\nelastic waves in the medium. In the quasistatic limit with instantaneous stress\ntransfer, the crack front exhibits dynamic critical phenomenon, with a second\norder like transition from a pinned to a moving phase as the applied load is\nincreased through a critical value. At criticality, the crack-front is\nself-affine, with a roughness exponent $\\zeta =0.34\\pm 0.02$. The dynamic\nexponent $z$ is found to be equal to $ 0.74\\pm 0.03$ and the correlation length\nexponent $\\nu =1.52\\pm 0.02$.

Sound-travel time delays in the stress\ntransfer do not change the static exponents but the dynamic exponent $z$\nbecomes exactly one.

In finite systems, the velocity also shows\nhysteretic behaviour as a function of the loading. These results suggest a\nfirst order like transition.
