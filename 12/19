When the\nscalar field $f$ is minimally coupled to the metric field$(H(\\phi)=1)$ the\ntheory is equivalent, up to a boundary contribution,to a theory of three free\nscalar fields with indefinite kinetic terms, irrespective of the particular\nform of the potential $V(\\phi)$. If the potential is an exponential function of\nthe dilaton one recovers a generalized form of the classical canonical\ntransformation of Liouville theory. When $f$ is a dilaton coupled scalar\n$(H(\\phi)=\\phi)$ and the potential is an arbitrary power of the dilaton the\ntheory is also canonically equivalent to a theory of three free fields with a\nMinkowskian target space. In the simplest case $(V(\\phi)=0)$ we provide an\nexplicit free field realization of the Einstein-Rosen midisuperspace.
