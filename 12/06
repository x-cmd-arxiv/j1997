The analogue of the odd number theorem for cusped density\ndistributions is given. Density cusps are classified into strong, isothermal or\nweak, according to their lensing properties. Strong cusps cause multiple\nimaging for any source position, whereas isothermal and weak cusps give rise to\nonly one image for distant sources. Isothermal cusps always possess a\npseudo-caustic. When the source crosses the pseudo-caustic, the number of\nimages changes by unity.Two families of cusped galaxy and cluster models are\nexamined in detail. The double power-law family has an inner cusp, followed by\na transition region and an outer envelope. One member of this family -- the\nisothermal double power-law model -- possesses an exceedingly scarce property,\nnamely, the lens equation is exactly solvable for any source position. This\nmeans that the magnifications, the time delay and the lensing cross-sections\nare all readily available. The model has a three dimensional density that is\ncusped like $r^{-2}$ at small radii and falls off like $r^{-4}$ asymptotically.\nThus, it provides a very useful representation of the lensing properties of a\ngalaxy or cluster of finite total mass with a flat rotation curve. The second\nset of models studied is the single power-law family. These are single density\ncusps of infinite extent. The properties of the critical curves and caustics\nand the behaviour of the lenses in the presence of external shear are all\ndiscussed in some detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 1997 18:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These fields are taken as a\nclassical representation of photons, \"classical photons\". They are all\ntransversal photons; there are no scalar nor longitudinal photons and the\nLorentz gauge condition is automatically satisfied. The angular distribution of\nemitted photons reproduces the directions of maximum emission of the standard\nformalism. The Maxwell formalism in terms of continuous and distributed fields\nis retrieved by the smearing of these discrete fields over the light-cone, and\nin this process scalar and longitudinal photons are necessarily created and\nadded. Divergences and singularities are by-products of this averaging process.\nThe discrete and the continuous formalisms are not equivalent. The discrete one\nis superior for not having divergencies, singularities, unphysical degrees of\nfreedom, for describing processes of creation and annihilation of particles\ninstead of advanced solutions, for having a natural explanation for the photon,\nand for generating the continuous formalism as an effective one. It enlightens\nthe meaning and the origin of the non-physical photons in the standard\nformalism. The standard theory based on average continuous fields is more\nconvenient and appropriate for dealing with a large number of charges and for\nrelatively large distances, but for few charges or for the field configuration\nin a charge close neighborhood the discrete field description is mandatorily\nrequired for avoiding inconsistencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Dec 1997 11:37:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 1998 20:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}
