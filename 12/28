As an\napplication we give a proof of the extended future tube conjecture. This is the\nassertion that G.X is a domain of holomorphy in the case where X is the N-fold\nproduct of the tube domain in C^4 over the positive light cone in R^4 and G is\nthe connected complex Lorentz group acting diagonally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Dec 1997 03:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We also reduce\nthese volumes for a large class of hyperkahler quotients to simpler integrals.\nThese quotients include complex coadjoint orbits, instanton moduli spaces on\nR^4 and ALE manifolds, Hitchin spaces, and moduli spaces of parabolic Higgs\nbundles on Riemann surfaces. In the case of Hitchin spaces the evaluation of\nthe volume reduces to a summation over solutions of Bethe Ansatz equations for\nthe non-linear Schroedinger system.
