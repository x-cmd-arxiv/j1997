Introducing a critical distance\nscale, a, below 10E-25 cm (the wavelength scale of the highest-energy observed\ncosmic rays) allows to consider models, compatible with standard tests of\nspecial relativity, where a small violation of Lorentz symmetry (a can, for\ninstance, be the Planck length) leads to a deformed relativistic kinematics\n(DRK) producing dramatic effects on the properties of very high-energy cosmic\nrays. For instance, the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff does no longer\napply and particles which are unstable at low energy (neutron, some hadronic\nresonances like the Delta++, possibly several nuclei...) become stable at very\nhigh energy. In these models, an absolute local rest frame exists (the vacuum\nrest frame, VRF) and special relativity is a low-momentum limit. We discuss the\npossible effects of Lorentz symmetry violation (LSV) on kinematics and\ndynamics, as well as the cosmic-ray energy range (well below the energy scale\nassociated to the fundamental length) and experiments (on earth and from space)\nwhere they could be detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 1997 23:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
