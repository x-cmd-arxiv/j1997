A higher genus analogue should involve the explicit\nconstruction of a curve whose jacobian is isogenous to the jacobian of a given\ncurve. The doubling of the period matrix means that the kernel of the isogeny\nshould be a lagrangian subgroup of the group of points of order 2 in the\njacobian. In genus 2 such a construction was given classically by Humbert and\nwas studied more recently by Bost and Mestre. In this article we give such a\nconstruction for general curves of genus 3. We also give a similar but simpler\nconstruction for hyperelliptic curves of genus 3. We show that the\nhyperelliptic construction is a degeneration of the general one, and we prove\nthat the kernel of the induced isogeny on jacobians is a lagrangian subgroup of\nthe points of order 2.

A finite-field counterpart of an Onsager vortex-loop\ntransition in extreme type-II superconductors renders the vortex liquid phase-\nincoherent when the Abrikosov vortex lattice undergoes a first order melting\ntransition. For the filling fractions considered in this paper $f$ given by\n$1/f=12,14,16,20,25,32,48,64,72,84,96,112$, and 128, the vortex liquid phase is\nnot describable as a liquid of well-defined field induced vortex lines. This is\ndue to the proliferation of thermally induced closed vortex-loops with dia-\nmeters of order the magnetic length in the problem, resulting in a \"percolation\ntransition\" driven by non-field induced vortices also transverse to the direc-\ntion of the applied magnetic field. This immediately triggers flux-line lattice\nmelting and loss of phase-coherence in all direction. In a non-relativistic 2D\nboson-analogy picture, this latter feature would correspond to a vanishing mass\nof the bosons. Scaling functions for the specific heat are calculated in zero\nand finite magnetic field. From this we conclude that the critical region is of\norder 10% of $T_c$ for a mass anisotropy $\\sqrt{M_z/M}=3$, and increases with\nincreasing mass anisotropy. The entropy jump at the melting transition is cal-\nculated as a function of magnetic field for a mass-ansitropy slightly lower\nthan that in $YBCO$, and found to be $\\Delta S=0.1k_B$ per vortex panncake,\nindependent of the magnetic field for the filling fractions considered here.\nThis is slightly lower than experimental values of $\\Delta S \\approx 0.4k_B$\nfound experimentally for $YBCO$. We attribute this to the slightly lower mass\nanisotropy used in our simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 1997 12:04:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 1998 17:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
