In the absence of\na strong UV flux, the gas is predominantly neutral and may form clouds with HI\ncolumn density NHI > 10^18 cm^-2. Due to their high densities and high HI\ncolumn densities, these clouds are not destroyed by the onset of the UV\nbackground at a later time. Thus, if not disrupted by other processes, such as\nmergers into larger systems or `blow away' by supernovae, they will produce\nLLS. We show that the observed number density of LLS at high redshifts can well\nbe reproduced by the survived `minihalos' in hierarchical clustering models\nsuch as the standard cold dark matter model. The number density of LLS in such\na population increases with z even beyond the redshifts accessible to current\nobservations and dies off quickly at z < 2. This population is distinct from\nother populations because the absorbing systems have small velocity widths and\na close to primordial chemical composition.

This is in contrast to three dimensions where the\neffective interaction has negligible weight at frequencies $\\sim \\Delta$, the\nsuperconducting gap. The quasiparticle interactions give rise to\nstrong-coupling effects in experimental quantities which are beyond the\nconventional Eliashberg treatment of superconductivity. The present calculation\noffers an explanation of why these effects are much larger in 2D than in 3D\nsuperconductors and, in particular, why the analogous strong-coupling effects\ndue to quasiparticle interactions are seen in data on the quasi-2D cuprate\nsuperconductors. the strong-coupling features seen in data on the cuprates are\ndiscussed in light of the present calculation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 1997 16:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
