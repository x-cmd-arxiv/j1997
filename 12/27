Our survey covers a wide area (350 deg < l < 25 deg, |b| < 3\ndeg) with a spatial resolution of 15'. We employed a new observing method\ncalled the ``fast spectral scanning'' to make large-scale observations\nefficiently.\n  Strong [C II] line emission was detected from almost all areas we observed.\nIn the general Galactic plane, the spatial distribution of the [C II] line\nemission correlates very well with that of far-infrared continuum emission, but\ndiffuse components are more prominent in the [C II] line emission; the\nI_[CII]/I_FIR ratio is ~0.6 % for diffuse components but is ~0.2 % for compact\nsources such as active star-forming regions. In the Galactic center region, on\nthe other hand, the distribution of the [C II] line emission is quite different\nfrom that of the far-infrared continuum emission, and the I_[CII]/I_FIR ratio\nis systematically lower there.\n  The FWHM velocity resolution of our instrument is 175 km/s, but we determined\nthe central velocity of the line at each observed point very precisely with\nstatistical errors as small as +- 6 km/s. The longitudinal distribution of the\ncentral velocity clearly shows the differential rotation pattern of the\nGalactic disk and also violent velocity fields around the Galactic center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Dec 1997 04:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Thermally\nactivated conductivities and hopping transport were investigated in the integer\nquantum Hall regime. The predominant transport processes in two dimensions are\ndiscussed. The implications of transport regime on prefactor universality and\non the relation between $\\rho_{xx}$ and $\\rho_{xy}$ are studied. Particularly\nin the Landau level tails, strictly linear dependence\n$\\delta\\rho_{xy}(\\rho_{xx})$ was found, with pronounced asymmetries with\nrespect to the plateau centre. At low temperatures, Ohmic (temperature\ndependent) as well as non-Ohmic (current dependent) transport were investigated\nand analysed on the basis of variable-range hopping theory. The non-Ohmic\nregime could successfully be described by an effective electron temperature\nmodel. The results from either the Ohmic transport or from a comparison of\nOhmic and non-Ohmic data allowed to determine the localization length $\\xi$ in\ntwo different ways. The observed divergence of $\\xi(\\nu)$ with the filling\nfactor $\\nu$ approaching a Landau level centre, is in qualitative agreement\nwith scaling theories of electron localization. The absolute values of $\\xi$\nfar from the $\\rho_{xx}$ peaks are compared with theoretical predictions. On\none hand, discrepancies between the $\\xi$ results obtained from the two\nexperimental methods are attributed to an inhomogeneous electric field\ndistribution. Extrapolation yields an effective width of dominant potential\ndrop of about $100 mu$m.
