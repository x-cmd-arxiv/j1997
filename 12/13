Introducing a decrease of vector meson masses in hot dense medium, we\nfind that the low-mass dilepton enhancement can be satisfactorily explained.\nFurthermore, to explain the intermediate-mass dilepton enhancement in heavy-ion\ncollisions, secondary processes such as $\\pi a_1\\to l{\\bar l}$ are found to be\nvery important. Finally, the single photon spectra in our calculations with\neither free or in-medium meson masses do not exceed the upper limit measured by\nthe WA80 Collaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 1997 23:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The problem of\nconstructing intertwining operator algebras from representations of suitable\nvertex operator algebras were solved implicitly earlier in [H3]\n(q-alg/9505019). In the present paper, we generalize the geometric and operadic\nformulation of the notion of vertex operator algebra given in [H1], [H2], [HL1]\n(hep-th/9301009), [HL2] and [H6] to the notion of intertwining operator\nalgebra. We show that the category of intertwining operator algebras of central\ncharge c is isomorphic to the category of algebras over rational genus-zero\nmodular functors (certain analytic partial operads) of central charge c\nsatisfying certain generalized meromorphicity. This result is one main step in\nthe construction of genus-zero conformal field theories from representations of\nvertex operator algebras announced in [H5] (q-alg/9512024). One byproduct of\nthe proof of the present isomorphism theorem is a geometric construction of\n(framed) braid group representations from intertwining operator algebras and\nthus from representations of suitable vertex operator algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Dec 1997 06:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
