The possibility to suppress the six-lepton SM\nbackground, when present, by the unnatural initial beam polarizations is\ninvestigated. It is shown that the four-lepton LFV processes are amenable to\nexperimental study in the lepton-lepton collisions in the most favourable cases\nup to the underlying scale of order 100 TeV. Studying these processes should\nprovide an essential part of the physics program for the next generation lepton\ncolliders to unravel the outstanding flavour/family problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 1997 16:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 1997 18:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}
