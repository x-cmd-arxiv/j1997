The renormalization of the off-diagonal\nCoulomb field acting within a nucleus, by the residual strong interaction is\ncalculated analytically in a simplified RPA. From the expression for the\nsuppression coefficient of the isospin violating part of the Coulomb field, the\nisospin violating spreading widths of isobaric analog states are derived. The\nresulting reduction of the width is in agreement with the data on the isospin\nsymmetry restoration and with some earlier evaluations of the isospin violating\nspreading widths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 1997 13:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
