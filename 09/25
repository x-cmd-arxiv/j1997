These algorithms divided the work spatially\nor by spectral lines, that is distributing the radial zones, individual\nspectral lines, or characteristic rays among different processors and employ,\nin addition task parallelism for logically independent functions (such as\natomic and molecular line opacities).

However, for\nsophisticated NLTE models of both static and moving atmospheres needed to\naccurately describe, e.g., novae and supernovae, the number of wavelength\npoints is very large (200,000--300,000) and hence parallelization over\nwavelength can lead both to considerable speedup in calculation time and the\nability to make use of the aggregate memory available on massively parallel\nsupercomputers.

After a description of the hardware configurations\navailable to us at Marseille, and the usefulness of on-line analysis, we\nconcentrate on the performance and accuracy of the direct summation and tree\ncode software. For the former we discuss the sources of round-off errors. The\nstandard Barnes-Hut tree code has been modified for GRAPE-3, by dividing\nparticles into blocks and performing the tree traversal for the whole block.\nThe forces are then calculated by direct summation over the whole interaction\nlist. The performance of the tree code depends on the number of particles in\nthe block, the optimum number depending on the speed of the front end and the\nnumber of boards. The time per step scales with the number of particles, and\ndecreases only weakly as the tolerance increases. We discuss the effect of the\nfront end and compare performances with those of general purpose computers.\n  The accuracy of both direct summation and the tree code is discussed as\nfunction of the number of particles and the softening. The increased role of\ndirect summation in the force calculation enhances the accuracy compared to the\nstandard tree code. Finally, we follow the evolution of an isolated barred\ngalaxy using different hardware and software in order to assess the reliability\nof our results. We find excellent agreement between the pattern speed of the\nbar in direct summation simulations run on the high precision GRAPE-4 machines\nand on our GRAPE-3 system. The agreement with the tree code is very good for\ntolerance values smaller than about 1.0.\n  We conclude that GRAPE-3 systems are well suited for collisionless\nsimulations, in particular those of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 1997 11:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

It is argued that in the theories admitting a violation of the naive\nno-hair conjecture the structure of singularity is essentially affected by the\n\"hair roots\". This invalidates an image of a non-Abelian black hole as a\nSchwarzschild black hole sitting inside the soliton. We give an analytic\ndescription of the generic oscillatory approach to the singularity in the pure\nEYM theory in terms of a divergent discrete sequence and show that the mass\nfunction is exponentially growing \"in average\". The second type of a generic\napproach to the singularity in hairy black holes is a \"power-law mass\ninflation\" which is realized in the theories including scalar fields. Both\nsingularities are spacelike and no Cauchy horizons are met in the full interior\nregion in conformity with the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture. Black holes\nviolating this conjecture exist only for certain discrete values of the event\nhorizon radius thus forming a subset of zero measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 1997 11:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
