We show how, within this formalism, the non-locality of the\nperturbation with respect to the solitons is responsible for their confinement\nin the perturbed theory. The effects of the frequency ratio $\\alpha/\\beta$\nbeing a rational or irrational number and the occurrence of massless flows from\nthe gaussian to the Ising fixed point are also discussed. A generalisation of\nthe Ashkin-Teller model and the massive Schwinger model are presented as\nexamples of application of the formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 1997 13:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We show that the Bloch part of the equation can solved identically\nthrough $g$ and the remaining Maxwell equation becomes a second order\ndifferential equation with reduced set of variables due to the gauge invariance\nof the system. Our formulation clarifies the (nonabelian) symmetry structure of\nthe Maxwell-Bloch equations for various multi-level media in association with\nsymmetric spaces $G/H$. In particular, we associate nondegenerate two-level\nsystem for self-induced transparency with $G/H=SU(2)/U(1)$ and three-level $\\L\n$- or V-systems with $G/H = SU(3)/U(2)$. We give a detailed analysis for the\ntwo-level case in the matrix potential formalism, and address various new\nproperties of the system including soliton numbers, effective potential energy,\ngauge and discrete symmetries, modified pulse area, conserved topological and\nnontopological charges.
