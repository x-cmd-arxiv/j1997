The redshift\nof the absorber is greater than the redshift of the quasar, so the system\nresembles the z(abs) ~ z(em) damped absorber at z=2.81 towards the quasar\nPKS0528-250. We have previously reported the detection of Ly-alpha emission\nfrom the latter absorber, one of only two damped absorbers for which Ly-alpha\nemission has unambiguously been detected. The resemblance between the\nPKS0528-250 and Q0151+048A systems is made closer by the detection of a weak\nemission feature in the trough of the Q0151+048A absorber. This leads us to\nconsider whether these z(abs) ~ z(em) DLA absorbers are different objects to\nthe intervening DLA absorbers. Two possibilities are examined and rejected.\nFirstly the Q0151+048A and PKS0528-250 z(abs) ~ z(em) absorbers appear to be\nunrelated to the intrinsic absorbers (i.e. gas close to the quasar nucleus,\nejected by the quasar), as intrinsic absorbers are of higher metallicity, have\nhigher ionisation parameter, and show complex absorption profiles. Secondly\nthese two DLA absorbers cannot be equated with the gaseous disks of the quasar\nhost galaxies, as the absorber redshifts differ significantly from the quasar\nsystemic redshifts. It is likely, then, that intrinsically the z(abs) ~ z(em)\nDLA absorbers are the same as the intervening DLA absorbers, so that\npeculiarities in some of the z(abs) ~ z(em) absorbers can be ascribed to their\ndifferent environment i.e. proximity to the quasar, or membership of the same\ncluster as the quasar.

In particular, we analyze in detail the properties of sandpile and\nforest-fire (FF) models. In analogy with other non-equilibrium critical\nphenomena, we identify the order parameter with the density of ``active'' sites\nand the control parameters with the driving rates. Depending on the values of\nthe control parameters, the system is shown to reach a subcritical (absorbing)\nor super-critical (active) stationary state. Criticality is analyzed in terms\nof the singularities of the zero-field susceptibility. In the limit of\nvanishing control parameters, the stationary state displays scaling\ncharacteristic of self-organized criticality (SOC). We show that this limit\ncorresponds to the breakdown of space-time locality in the dynamical rules of\nthe models. We define a complete set of critical exponents, describing the\nscaling of order parameter, response functions, susceptibility and correlation\nlength in the subcritical and supercritical states. In the subcritical state,\nthe response of the system to small perturbations takes place in avalanches. We\nanalyze their scaling behavior in relation with branching processes.

We\ntreat bulk and boundary dissipation and introduce a new critical exponent\nrelating dissipation and finite size effects. We present numerical simulations\nthat confirm our results.
