An investigation of the spectral energy distributions of the\ngalaxies shows that the contribution of the aligned blue component to the\nK--band light is generally small (about 10%). The radial intensity profiles of\nthe galaxies are well matched at radii <~ 35 kpc by de Vaucouleurs' law,\ndemonstrating that the K--band light is dominated by that of an elliptical\ngalaxy. There is no evidence for a nuclear point source, in addition to the de\nVaucouleurs profile, with a contribution >~15% of the total K--band flux\ndensity, except in two cases, 3C22 and 3C41. Large characteristic radii are\nderived, indicating that the 3CR galaxies must be highly evolved dynamically,\neven at a redshift of one. At radii > 35 kpc, a combined galaxy profile clearly\nshows an excess of emission reminiscent of cD--type halos. This supports other\nindependent evidence for the hypothesis that the distant 3CR galaxies lie in\nmoderately rich (proto--)clusters. Since the nearby FR II galaxies in the 3CR\ncatalogue lie in more diffuse environments and do not possess cD halos, the\ngalactic environments of the 3CR galaxies must change with redshift. The K-z\nrelation of the 3CR galaxies cannot, therefore, be interpreted using a standard\n`closed-box, passive stellar evolution' model. We offer a new interpretation,\nand compare the model with the K-z relations of lower power radio galaxies and\nbrightest cluster galaxies.

We consider the problem of divergences and renormalization in\nthe semiclassical field theory in the Hamiltonian formulation. Although\ndivergences in quantum field theory are usually associated with loop Feynman\ngraphs, divergences in the Hamiltonian approach may arise even at the tree\nlevel. For example, formally calculated probability of pair creation in the\nleading order of the semiclassical expansion may be divergent. This observation\nwas interpretted as an argumentation for considering non-unitary evolution\ntransformations, as well as non-equivalent representations of canonical\ncommutation relations at different time moments. However, we show that this\ndifficulty can be overcomed without the assumption about non-unitary evolution.\nWe consider first the Schrodinger equation for the regularized field theory\nwith ultraviolet and infrared cutoffs. We study the problem of making a limit\nto the local theory. To consider such a limit, one should impose not only the\nrequirement on the counterterms entering to the quantum Hamiltonian but also\nthe requirement on the initial state in the theory with cutoffs. We find such a\nrequirement in the leading order of the semiclassical expansion and show that\nit is invariant under time evolution.
