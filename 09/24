Chief among\nthese are the fraction of particles that are randomly localized and the scaling\nfunctions that describe the order parameter and (equivalently) the statistical\ndistribution of localization lengths for these localized particles. The purpose\nof this Paper is to discuss the origins and consequences of this universality,\nand in doing so, three themes are explored. First, a replica-Landau-type\napproach is formulated for the universality class of systems that are composed\nof extended objects connected by permanent random constraints and undergo\namorphous solidification at a critical density of constraints. This formulation\ngeneralizes the cases of randomly cross-linked and end-linked macromolecular\nsystems, discussed previously. The universal replica free energy is\nconstructed, in terms of the replica order parameter appropriate to amorphous\nsolidification, the value of the order parameter is obtained in the liquid and\namorphous solid states, and the chief universal characteristics are determined.\nSecond, the theory is reformulated in terms of the distribution of local static\ndensity fluctuations rather than the replica order parameter. It is shown that\na suitable free energy can be constructed, depending on the distribution of\nstatic density fluctuations, and that this formulation yields precisely the\nsame conclusions as the replica approach. Third, the universal predictions of\nthe theory are compared with the results of extensive numerical simulations of\nrandomly cross-linked macromolecular systems, due to Barsky and Plischke, and\nexcellent agreement is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 1997 17:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We compute\nthe maximum entropy of a vacuum-bounded state with a given energy for a\none-dimensional model, with the aid of numerical calculations on a lattice. For\nlarge energies we show that a vacuum-bounded system with length $L_in$ and a\ngiven energy has entropy no more than $S^rb + (1/6) \\ln S^rb$, where $S^rb$ is\nthe entropy in a rigid box with the same size and energy. Assuming that the\nstate resulting from the evaporation of a black hole is similar to a\nvacuum-bounded state, and that the similarity between vacuum-bounded and rigid\nbox problems extends from 1 to 3 dimensions, we apply these results to the\nblack hole information paradox. Under these assumptions we conclude that large\namounts of information cannot be emitted in the final explosion of a black\nhole.\n  We also consider vacuum-bounded states at very low energies and come to the\nsurprising conclusion that the entropy of such a state can be much higher than\nthat of a rigid box state with the same energy. For a fixed $E$ we let $L_in'$\nbe the length of a rigid box which gives the same entropy as a vacuum-bounded\nstate of length $L_in$. In the $E\\to 0$ limit we conjecture that the ratio\n$L_in'/L_in$ grows without bound and support this conjecture with numerical\ncomputations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 1997 18:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A trend of competition between rock-salt and\nhexagonal ring-like isomers is found and discussed in terms of the relative\nionic sizes. The main conclusion is that an approximate value of r_C/r_A=0.5\n(where r_C and r_A are the cationic and anionic radii) separates the hexagonal\nfrom the rock-salt structures. The classical electrostatic part of the total\nenergy at the equilibrium geometry is enough to explain these trends. The magic\nnumbers in the size range studied are n= 4, 6 and 9, and these are universal\nsince they occur for all alkali-halides and do not depend on the specific\nground state geometry. Instead those numbers allow for the formation of compact\nclusters.

These two effects preserve the general conclusions achieved\nthus far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 1997 16:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
