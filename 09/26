Using the Press-Schechter approximation, we show\nthat the cluster abundance evolution is a strong function of sigma8: d log n/dz\n~ -1/sigma8^2; low sigma8 models evolve exponentially faster than high sigma8\nmodels, for a given mass cluster. For example, the number density of Coma-like\nclusters decreases by a factor of ~10^3$ from z = 0 to z ~ 0.5 for sigma8=0.5\nmodels, while the decrease is only a factor of ~5 for sigma8 ~ 1.

A large range of model dark matter distributions are examined,\nunder the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry, to\ndetermine the widest possible allowed range on the total mass of the cluster.\nWithin a radius of 1 Mpc, the total cluster mass is tightly constrained to be\n(6.2 +/- 0.9) x 10**14 solar masses and the ratio of luminous baryonic matter\nto total matter lies between 13% and 17%. Within a radius of 3 Mpc the total\nmass is (1.3 +/- 0.5) x 10**15 solar masses and the luminous matter fraction is\n20%-40%. I find that the ``universal'' dark matter density profile proposed by\nNavarro, Frenk, and White, based on N-body simulations of a standard\ncold-dark-matter dominated Universe, predicts a steep temperature gradient\nwithin the core of the cluster that is a poor fit to the Coma data and can be\nrejected at greater than 99% confidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 1997 15:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The 2-d classical O(3)\nmodel emerges from the (2+1)-d quantum Heisenberg model formulated in terms of\nquantum spins. Dimensional reduction is demonstrated explicitly by simulating\ncorrelation lengths up to 350,000 lattice spacings using a loop cluster\nalgorithm. In the framework of D-theory, gauge theories are formulated in terms\nof quantum links --- the gauge analogs of quantum spins. Quantum links are\nparallel transporter matrices whose elements are non-commuting operators. They\ncan be expressed as bilinears of anticommuting fermion constituents. In quantum\nlink models dimensional reduction to four dimensions occurs, due to the\npresence of a 5-d Coulomb phase, whose existence is confirmed by detailed\nsimulations using standard lattice gauge theory. Using Shamir's variant of\nKaplan's fermion proposal, in quantum link QCD quarks appear as edge states of\na 5-d slab. This naturally protects their chiral symmetries without\nfine-tuning. The first efficient cluster algorithm for a gauge theory with a\ncontinuous gauge group is formulated for the U(1) quantum link model. Improved\nestimators for Wilson loops are constructed, and dimensional reduction to\nordinary lattice QED is verified numerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 1997 19:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We prove that for many choices of rank $r$\nand level $k$, the number of these variables is the minimum possible, and we\nconjecture that it is in fact minimal for most $r$ and $k$.
