Focusing on the currently relevant case of contact interactions\nbetween the atoms, the theory is developed within a random phase approximation\nwith exchange. This approach is naturally introduced in a two-fluid description\nby expressing the density response of both the condensate and the\nnon-condensate in terms of the response of a Hartree-Fock reference gas to the\nselfconsistent Hartree-Fock potentials. Such an approximate account of\ncorrelations (i) preserves an interplay between the condensate and the\nnon-condensate through off-diagonal components of the response, which instead\nvanish in the Hartree-Fock-Bogolubov approximation; and (ii) yields a common\nresonant structure for the four partial response functions. The theory reduces\nto the temperature-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogolubov-Popov approximation for the\nfluctuations of the condensate when its coupling with the density fluctuations\nof the non-condensate is neglected. Analytic results are presented which are\namenable to numerical calculations and to inclusion of damping rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 1997 16:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
