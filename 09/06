A new parametrization for the Calogero-Moser spectral curves\nis found, which exhibits the classical vacuum expectation values of the scalar\nfield of the gauge multiplet. The one-loop perturbative correction to the\neffective prepotential is evaluated explicitly, and found to agree with quantum\nfield theory predictions. A renormalization group equation for the variation\nwith respect to the coupling is derived for the effective prepotential, and may\nbe evaluated in a weak coupling series using residue methods only.
