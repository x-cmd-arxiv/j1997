However, the smallness of the observed reflection component in Cygnus\nX-1, in addition to other constraints, seem to rule out the two-phase model\n(otherwise successful in the case of Seyfert Galaxies) for GBHCs. Here, we show\nthat the latter conclusion is based on a number of key assumptions that\nprobably are not valid when the overlying corona is patchy, e.g., when it is\ncomprised of localized magnetic flares above the disk. We show that in GBHCs\nthe energy deposited by the X-rays cannot be re-radiated fast enough to\nmaintain equilibrium, unless the X-ray skin heats up to the Compton\ntemperature, at which point the gas is mostly ionized. This leads to a\nsubstantially reduced cooling rate for the active regions due to the\ncorrespondingly smaller number of re-injected low-energy photons. We model this\neffect by introducing a transition layer situated between the corona and the\ncold disk, and find that the resulting spectrum is harder than that obtained\nwith the standard (and unrealistic) two-phase model. We apply this model to\nCygnus X-1 and show that it can account for its observed spectrum. This\nanalysis therefore seems to provide a consistentpicture for both Seyfert\nGalaxies and GBHCs within the same framework, with differences arising due to\nthe changing physical conditionsin the two categories of sources, rather than\ndue to an ad hoc variation of the model parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 1997 03:31:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 1998 00:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
