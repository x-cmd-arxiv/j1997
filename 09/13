For five selected\nvalues of the star's gravitational mass (in the interval between 1.0 and 1.8\nsolar masses) and for each equation of state, the star's angular momentum is\nvaried from J=0 to the Keplerian limit J=J_{max}. For each neutron-star\nconfiguration we compute Q, the quadrupole moment of the mass distribution. We\nshow that for given values of M and J, |Q| increases with the stiffness of the\nequation of state. For fixed mass and equation of state, the dependence on J is\nwell reproduced with a simple quadratic fit, Q \\simeq - aJ^2/M c^2, where c is\nthe speed of light, and a is a parameter of order unity depending on the mass\nand the equation of state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 1997 20:33:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 1998 00:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

The idea is to construct a projection from $U(p)$- onto\n$Gl(p,\\mathbb{C})$-invariant functions, whose kernel is an ideal.

These conditions\nare given in two forms - respectively local and global in the individual photon\nnumber probabilities. Central to the first approach is the recognition of the\nimportant fact that the quantities n!p(n) are moments of a quasiprobability\ndistribution, notwithstanding the fact that p(n)'s can by themselves be\nconsidered as a probability distribution over the nonnegative integers. This\nleads to local classicality conditions involving p(n)'s for only a small number\nof values of n. This local approach enables us to present detailed quantitative\nstatements on the connection between nonclassicality and oscillations in the\nphoton number distribution. The second approach is in terms of the traditional\nfactorial moments of p(n). Equivalence of the two approaches is established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Sep 1997 11:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
