By analyzing the concept of ``fluid particle'' from the point of view\nof a Voronoi tessellation of a molecular fluid, we propose an heuristic\nderivation of a dissipative particle dynamics algorithm that incorporates shear\nforces between dissipative particles. The inclusion of these non-central shear\nforces requires the consideration of angular velocities of the dissipative\nparticles in order to comply with the conservation of angular momentum. It is\nshown that the equilibrium statistical mechanics requirement that the linear\nand angular velocity fields are Gaussian is sufficient to construct the random\nthermal forces between dissipative particles. The proposed algorithm is very\nsimilar in structure to the (isothermal) smoothed particle dynamics algorithm.\nIn this way, this work represents a generalization of smoothed particle\ndynamics that incorporates consistently thermal fluctuations and exact angular\nmomentum conservation. It contains also the dissipative particle dynamics\nalgorithm as a special case. Finally, the kinetic theory of the dissipative\nparticles is derived and explicit expressions of the transport coefficients of\nthe fluid in terms of model parameters are obtained.

The initial\nvelocity is homogeneous and Gaussian with a spectrum proportional to $k^n$ at\nsmall wavenumbers $k$ and falling off quickly at large wavenumbers. In physical\nspace, at sufficiently large distances, there is an ``outer region'', where the\nvelocity correlation function preserves exactly its initial form (a power law)\nwhen $n$ is not an even integer. When $1<n<2$ the spectrum, at long times, has\nthree scaling regions : first, a $|k|^n$ region at very small $k$\\ms1 with a\ntime-independent constant, stemming from this outer region, in which the\ninitial conditions are essentially frozen; second, a $k^2$ region at\nintermediate wavenumbers, related to a self-similarly evolving ``inner region''\nin physical space and, finally, the usual $k^{-2}$ region, associated to the\nshocks. The switching from the $|k|^n$ to the $k^2$ region occurs around a wave\nnumber $k_s(t) \\propto t^{-1/[2(2-n)]}$, while the switching from $k^2$ to\n$k^{-2}$ occurs around $k_L(t)\\propto t^{-1/2}$ (ignoring logarithmic\ncorrections in both instances).
