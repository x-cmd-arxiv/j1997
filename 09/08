After the plateau phase (t >120 days),\nthe light curve dropped by 3.5 mag in V in only 12 days. Between 125 and 197\ndays after explosion the supernova faded substantially faster than the decay\nrate of Co-56, and by day 197 it was 3.6 magnitudes less luminous in R compared\nto SN 1987A. The low R-luminosity could indicate less than 0.0026 {+0.0017}/\n{-0.0011} Msun of Ni-56 ejected at the explosion, but the emission between 125\nand 197 days must then have been dominated by an additional power source, pre-\nsumably circumstellar interaction. Alternatively, the late light curve was\ndominated by Co-56 decay. In this case, the mass of the ejected Ni-56 was 0.015\n{+0.012}/{-0.008} Msun, and the rapid fading between 125 and 197 days was most\nlikely due to dust formation. Though this value of the mass is higher than in\nthe case with the additional power source, it is still lower than estimated for\nany previous Type II supernova. Only progenitors with M(ZAMS) = 8-10 Msun and\nM(ZAMS) > 25 Msun are expected to eject such low masses of Ni-56.

We also consider more general nonlinear differential and\nintegral equations, and study the spaces of coefficients and solutions\nnaturally associated with these problems, as well as the corresponding\ncapacities.\n  Our characterizations of the existence of positive solutions take into\naccount the interplay between $v$, $w$, and the corresponding Green's kernel.\nThey are not only sufficient, but also necessary, and are established without\nany a priori regularity assumptions on $v$ and $w$; we also obtain sharp\ntwo-sided estimates of solutions up to the boundary. Some of our results are\nnew even if $v \\equiv 1$ and $\\Omega$ is a ball or half-space.\n  The corresponding weighted norm inequalities are proved for integral\noperators with kernels satisfying a refined version of the so-called $3\nG$-inequality by an elementary ``integration by parts'' argument. This also\ngives a new unified proof for some classical inequalities including the\nCarleson measure theorem for Poisson integrals and trace inequalities for Riesz\npotentials and Green potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 1997 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

For doubly excited states\ncorrelation becomes dominant. Photodetachment is the process where a negative\nion absorbs a photon and as a consquence ejects the outermost electron. A new\ndetection scheme has been developed. The residual atom of a photodetachment is\nstate selectively ionised by resonance ionisation spectroscopy. Investigations\nof the photodetachment threshold of tellurium with neutral particle detection\nyielded an electron affinity of 1589618(5) m^-1. With state selective detection\nthe Li(2p) photodetachment threshold was investigated and the electron affinity\nwas determined to be 498490(17) m^-1. Resonance structure in the Li^-\nphotodetachment cross section near the Li(3p) threshold has been investigated.\nAccording to an assisting calculation this structure is analogous to the\nsymmetrically excited intrashell (_3{0}_3^+)^1P^o state in H^-. In He^- the\nthree doubly excited states, 1s3s4s ^4S, 1s3p^2 ^4P and 1s3p4p ^4P were\ninvestigated. The energy positions of all these resonances [1s3s4s ^4S:\nE_0=(2386803.1+-4.2) m^-1, Gamma=160(16) m^-1; 1s3p^2 ^4P: E_0=2.4782(55)x10^6\nm^-1, Gamma=40(3)x10^3 m^-1; 1s3p4p ^4P: E_0=2633297(40) m^-1, Gamma=492(35)\nm^-1] agree with a recent calculation. The width of the 1s3s4s ^4S resonance\nagrees with this calculation, but for the 1s3p^2 ^4P resonance there is a\nslight discrepancy and the 1s3p4p ^4P resonance is only half as broad as\npredicted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 1997 13:44:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 1997 19:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

Given an operator Q (a supercharge in physics\nlanguage) and an operator a (whose square equals the identity I), we derive a\ngeneral formula for an invariant Z(Q,a) depending on Q and a. In case a=I, our\nformula reduces to the McKean-Singer representation of the index of Q. The\nfunction Z is invariant in the following sense: if Q=Q(s) depends on a\nparameter s, and if Z(Q(s),a) is differentiable in s, then in fact Z(Q(s),a) is\nindependent of s. We give detailed conditions on Q(s) for which Z(Q(s),a) is\ndifferentiable in s. At the end of this paper, we consider a 2-dimensional\ngeneralization of our theory motivated by space-time supersymmetry. In the case\nthat expectations are given by functional integrals, Z(Q,a) has a simple\nintegral representation. We also explain in detail how our construction relates\nto Connes' entire cyclic cohomology, as well as to other frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 1997 14:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-06"}
