Our study has a total of 468 available velocities for galaxies\nin the region, 175 of them new. 414 galaxies are in the supercluster, about\nthree times the number used in the previous supercluster study. We verify the\nexistence of the three individual clusters and compute their individual\ndynamical parameters.

By analyzing the u-plane\nintegrals, the relation of Donaldson theory to N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheory can be described much more fully, the relation of Donaldson invariants\nto SW theory can be generalized to four-manifolds not of simple type, and\ninteresting formulas can be obtained for the class numbers of imaginary\nquadratic fields. We also show how the results generalize to extensions of\nDonaldson theory obtained by including hypermultiplet matter fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 1997 16:29:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 1997 14:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-07"}

In this regime the NN potential is\nconjectured to be the sum of a delta function and its derivatives. The question\nwe address is whether this sum can be consistently truncated at a given order\nin the derivative expansion, and systematically improved by going to higher\norders. Regularizing the Lippmann-Schwinger equation using a cutoff we find\nthat the cutoff can be taken to infinity only if the effective range is\nnegative. A positive effective range---which occurs in nature---requires that\nthe cutoff be kept finite and below the scale of the physics which has been\nintegrated out, i.e. O(m_\\pi). Comparison of cutoff schemes and dimensional\nregularization reveals that the physical scattering amplitude is sensitive to\nthe choice of regulator. Moreover, we show that the presence of some regulator\nscale, a feature absent in dimensional regularization, is essential if the\neffective field theory of NN scattering is to be useful. We also show that one\ncan define a procedure where finite cutoff dependence in the scattering\namplitude is removed order by order in the effective potential. However, the\ncharacteristic momentum in the problem is given by the cutoff, and not by the\nexternal momentum. It follows that in the presence of a finite cutoff there is\nno small parameter in the effective potential, and consequently no systematic\ntruncation of the derivative expansion can be made. We conclude that there is\nno effective field theory of NN scattering with nucleons alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 1997 18:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-17"}
