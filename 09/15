Consequently there is great interest in the computer simulation\nof black hole collisions and similar events, based on the numerical solution of\nthe Einstein field equations. In this note we introduce the scientific,\nmathematical, and computational problems and discuss the development of a\ncomputer code to solve the initial data problem for colliding black holes, a\nnonlinear elliptic boundary value problem posed in an unbounded three\ndimensional domain which is a key step in solving the full field equations. The\ncode is based on finite elements, adaptive meshes, and a multigrid solution\nprocess. Here we will particularly emphasize the mathematical and algorithmic\nissues arising in the generation of adaptive tetrahedral meshes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 1997 13:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Constraints for the omega - and sigma - meson\ncoupling constants with dibaryons following from the requirement of stability\nof dibaryon matter against compression are derived and the effect of sigma -\nand pi - meson exchange current contributions to the sigma - dibaryon coupling\nconstant is discussed. The mean-field solutions of the model are constructed.\nThe effective nucleon mass vanishes when the density of dibaryons approaches a\ncritical value about 0.15/fm^3. The Green's functions of the equilibrium binary\nmixture of nucleons and dibaryons are constructed by solving the Gorkov-Dyson\nsystem of equations in the no-loop approximation. We find that when the square\nof the sound velocity is positive, the dispersion laws for all elementary\nexcitations of the system are real functions. This indicates stability of the\nground state of the heterophase nucleon-dibaryon mixture. In the model\nconsidered, production of dibaryons becomes energetically favorable at higher\ndensities as compared to estimates based on a model of non-interacting nucleons\nand dibaryons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 1997 13:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
