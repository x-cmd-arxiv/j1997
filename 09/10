There have been a number of\nmulti-wavelength observations of 3C 279, and hence there are many ultraviolet\ndata for this object available in the UV archives. In this paper we present Ly\nalpha emission line measurements for 3C 279 using all the archival IUE SWP\nspectra from 1988 to 1996 and all archival HST/FOS G190H spectra from 1992 to\n1996. Individual archival IUE spectra of 3C 279 show weak Ly alpha emission at\n~1868 A (z = 0.536), which is easily seen in the co-added data. The Ly alpha\nemission is observed in all the HST/FOS spectra. The strength of Ly alpha is\nnearly constant (~5E-14 erg/cm2/s), while the 1750 A continuum varies by a\nfactor of ~50, from ~0.6 to 31.6E-15 erg/cm2/s/A. The behavior of the Ly alpha\nemission line flux and continuum flux is similar to that of the only other well\nobserved blazar, 3C 273, which shows constant line flux while the continuum\nvaries by a factor of ~3. This near-constancy of emission line flux in the two\nbest-studied blazars, suggests that the highly variable beamed continuum is not\na significant source of photoionization for the gas. Some other source, such as\nthermal emission from an accretion disk, must be providing a significant\nfraction of the photoionizing flux in these objects. The large amplitude\nvariability seen at gamma-ray energies must be due to changes in the energetic\nelectrons in the jet rather than changes in the external photon field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 1997 13:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We\nfind that magnetic fields have important effects on the dynamics and structure\nof radiative cooling jets, especially at the head. The presence of a helical\nfield suppresses the formation of the clumpy structure which is found to\ndevelop at the head of purely hydrodynamical jets. On the other hand, a cooling\njet embedded in a longitudinal magnetic field retains clumpy morphology at its\nhead. This fragmented structure resembles the knotty pattern commonly observed\nin HH objects behind the bow shocks of HH jets. This suggests that a strong\n(equipartition) helical magnetic field configuration is ruled out at the jet\nhead. Therefore, if strong magnetic fields are present, they are probably\npredominantly longitudinal in those regions. In both magnetic configurations,\nwe find that the confining pressure of the cocoon is able to excite\nshort-wavelength MHD K-H pinch modes that drive low-amplitude internal shocks\nalong the beam.

We perform\nself-consistent, density functional and spin density functional calculations\nfor the dots used in the recent experimental studies of Sivan et al. [PRL 77,\n1123 (1996)]. We directly compute the direct Coulomb matrix elements W_{pq},\nscreened by the gates, between self-consistent states. We show that diagonal\nelements (denoted U_p) are uniformly larger than off diagonal elements,\nresulting in spin polarization of the dot. We show that strongly scarred\nstates, which are quasi-one dimensional, have particularly large values of U_p\nwhich causes them to remain, partially occupied, at the Fermi surface as gate\nvoltage V_g is swept and more homogeneous, ``chaotic'' states pass through. We\nshow that ultimate double-filling of these scars results in large upward\nfluctuations of E_C. In addition, we show that V_g dependence of capacitances\nand level energies substantially enhances fluctuations in the gate voltage\nspacing dV_g of Coulomb oscillations, as compared to and distinct from\nfluctuations in the ``inverse compressibility'' (i.e. E_C). Moreover, these\ndependences modify the distribution of dV_g fluctuations so that purely upward\nfluctuations of E_C produce symmetric fluctuations in dV_g. Consequently, gate\nvoltage fluctuations (normalized by the appropriate capacitance ratio) are\nsubstantially greater than the single particle level spacing, Delta, but, as we\nshow by direct calculation, their temperature T scaling is consistent with\nDelta/T and not E_C/T, in complete agreement with experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 1997 13:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Any function U obtained in\nthis way must fulfil a system of three, first order, partial differential\nequations of the Hamilton-Jacobi type in the variables (q_{ij},P^{ij}).
