One possibility is that a cooling flow\nreplenishes the disk on this timescale and at angles that vary with radius.\nAnother possibility is that there is a pressure on the disk that is large\nenough to overcome the torque from the galaxy. We estimate this pressure and\nfind that it can be provided by ram pressure from an energetic interstellar\nmedium that is consistent with velocity dispersions observed in ionized gas and\ndensities estimated from the X-ray emission.
