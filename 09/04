It will be argued that there is an\nintimate relation between chiral symmetry breaking and correlations of Dirac\neigenvalues. In particular, we will focus on the microscopic spectral density\ndensity, i.e. the spectral density near zero virtuality on the scale of a\ntypical level spacing. The relation with Leutwyler-Smilga sum-rules will be\ndiscussed. Standard methods for the statistical analysis of quantum spectra\nwill be reviewed. Recent results on the application of Random Matrix Theory to\nspectra of 'complex' systems will be summarized. This leads to the introduction\nof a chiral Random Matrix Theory (chRMT) with the global symmetries of the QCD\npartition function. In the second lecture the chiral random matrix model will\nbe compared to QCD and some of its properties will be discussed. Our central\nconjecture is that correlations of QCD Dirac spectra are described by chRMT.

Resonance energies and oscillator strengths are obtained by exact\ndiagonalization of the Hamiltonian in a complete basis set, even far above the\nionization threshold. At high excitation energies around the Stark saddle point\nthe eigenenergies exhibit strong level repulsions when the angle between the\nfields is varied. The large avoided crossings occur between states with the\nsame approximately conserved principal quantum number, n, and this\nintramanifold mixing of states cannot be explained, not even qualitatively, by\nconventional perturbation theory. However, it is well reproduced by an extended\nperturbation theory which takes into account all couplings between the angular\nmomentum and Runge-Lenz vector. The large avoided crossings are interpreted as\na quantum manifestation of classical intramanifold chaos.
