Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains\nobstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter\ndiffering, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment.\nFurthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities\nor discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and\ncommunication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting\nindividual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their\ninflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their\ndomain-specificity hinders reusability. Our central hypothesis is that the key\nto such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of\nteamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination\nand communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models\nenable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing\nconsistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork,\ncalled STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions\n(Cohen & Levesque, 1991b); teamwork in STEAM is based on agents' building up a\n(partial) hierarchy of joint intentions (this hierarchy is seen to parallel\nGrosz & Kraus's partial SharedPlans, 1996). Furthermore, in STEAM, team members\nmonitor the team's and individual members' performance, reorganizing the team\nas necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM\nensures reduction in communication overheads of teamwork, with appropriate\nsensitivity to the environmental conditions.
