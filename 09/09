We find that the short range correlation enhances the delta - hole\nexcitation but suppresses the particle - hole excitation, it also suppresses\nthe pion condensation. We find that the effect of the short range correlation\non the pion dispersion relation depends very much on the form of the short\nrange correlation and the parameters involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 1997 15:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

At the 200 MeV H- linac, we have used this\ntechnique to measure beam density, and it has proved very helpful, especially\nin helping determine if there is any coupling present in x-y phase space.

We\nshow that this algebra governs a structure of the space of states in the\n$k-$fusion RSOS model specified by a pair of positive integers $(r,k)$, or\nequivalently a $q-$deformation of the coset conformal field theory\n$SU(2)_k\\times SU(2)_{r-k-2}/SU(2)_{r-2}$. Extending the work by Lukyanov and\nPugai corresponding to the case $k=1$, we gives a full set of screening\noperators for $k>1$. The algebra $U_{q,p}(\\hat{sl_2})$ has two interesting\ndegeneration limits, $p\\to 0$ and $p\\to 1$. The former limit yields the quantum\naffine algebra $U_{q}(\\hat{sl_2})$ whereas the latter yields the algebra ${\\cal\nA}_{\\hbar,\\eta}(\\hat{sl_2})$, the scaling limit of the elliptic algebra ${\\cal\nA}_{q,p}(\\hat{sl_2})$. Using this correspondence, we also obtain the highest\ncomponent of two types of vertex operators which can be regarded as\n$q-$deformations of the primary fields in the coset conformal field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 1997 08:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
