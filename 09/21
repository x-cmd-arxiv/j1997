Accordingly,\nthe authors suggested that observations of the spectra of single QSOs would\nreveal similar changes in emission line profiles and equivalent widths on a\ntime scale of a year or less. In order to test Steidel & Sargent's hypothesis,\nwe obtained in 1992 high quality spectra of 30 quasars with z(em) ~ 1 selected\nfrom the brighter QSOs in the sample of Steidel & Sargent (1991b), which those\nauthors had observed in 1989-90. We find that the spectra from the two epochs\nare remarkably similar for all QSOs, except for overall changes in fluxes and\nminor differences in continuum shape which are probably artifacts introduced by\nthe observing procedures. However, there are also changes in the equivalent\nwidths or shapes of the stronger emission lines on rest-frame time scales of\n1-1.5 years in about two thirds of the QSOs. These observations, therefore,\nsupport the notion that the spectra of the components in lensed QSOs need not\nbe exactly identical. Moreover, it should be expected that any differences\nbetween the components in such systems should change with time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Sep 1997 17:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
