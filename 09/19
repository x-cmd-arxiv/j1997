The application of the\nmethod to a simple diagonal disorder model uncovers a surprising result: a\nsharp (delta-function) response at zero temperature that is consistent with\nrecent experiments.

The flux profiles, composed of rigid flux lines that interact with 100\nor more vortices, are maintained in the Bean critical state and do not decay\naway from it. By directly determining vortex positions during avalanches in the\nplastically moving lattice, we find that experimentally observable voltage\nbursts correspond to the pulsing movement of vortices along branched channels\nor winding chains in a manner reminiscent of lightning strikes.

We analyze an explicit example\nfor which the relevant compact geometry of the 4-fold is given by $P^1$ fibered\nover $P^2$. In the field theory limit, this gives an effective U(1) gauge\ntheory with N=(2,2) supersymmetry in two dimensions. We find that the analog of\nthe SW curve is a K3 surface, and that the complex FI coupling is given by the\nmodular parameter of this surface. The FI potential itself coincides with the\nmiddle period of a meromorphic differential. However, it only shows up in the\neffective action if a certain 4-flux is switched on, and then supersymmetry\nappears to be non-perturbatively broken. This can be avoided by tuning the bare\nFI coupling by hand, in which case the supersymmetric minimum naturally\ncorresponds to a singular K3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 1997 14:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
