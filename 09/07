It is shown\nthat PA's tend to reduce the renormalization scale and scheme dependence as\ncompared to truncated series. In particular it is proven that in the limit\nwhere the $\\beta$ function is dominated by the 1-loop contribution, there is an\nexact symmetry that guarantees invariance of diagonal PA's under changing the\nrenormalization scale. In addition it is shown that in the large $\\beta_0$\napproximation diagonal PA's can be interpreted as a systematic method for\napproximating the flow of momentum in Feynman diagrams. This corresponds to a\nnew multiple scale generalization of the Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie (BLM) method\nto higher orders.
