The\ndynamics consists of two parts --- an irreversible dissipation into a heat bath\nand a reversible precession induced by a torque due to the local molecular\nfield. For quenches to zero temperature, we provide convincing arguments, both\nnumerically (Langevin simulation) and analytically (approximate closure scheme\ndue to Mazenko), that the torque is irrelevant at late times. We subject the\nMazenko closure scheme to systematic numerical tests. Such an analysis, carried\nout for the first time on a vector order parameter, shows that the closure\nscheme performs respectably well. For quenches to $T_c$, we show, to ${\\cal\nO}(\\epsilon^2)$, that the torque is irrelevant at the Wilson-Fisher fixed\npoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Sep 1997 16:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Both local and global characteristics\nof spectra are directly reconstructed from the recurrence equation for\northogonal polynomials associated with a given random matrix ensemble. It is\nestablished that an eigenvalue gap does not affect the local eigenvalue\ncorrelations which follow the universal sine and the universal multicritical\nlaws in the bulk and soft-edge scaling limits, respectively. By contrast,\nglobal smoothed eigenvalue correlations do reflect the presence of a gap, and\nare shown to satisfy a new universal law exhibiting a sharp dependence on the\nodd/even dimension of random matrices whose spectra are bounded. In the case of\nunbounded spectrum, the corresponding universal `density-density' correlator is\nconjectured to be generic for chaotic systems with a forbidden gap and broken\ntime reversal symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Sep 1997 07:28:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 1997 07:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

These data sets consist of single\nblack holes distorted by strong gravitational waves, and mimic the late stages\nof coalescing black holes. Through comparison with results from well\nestablished axisymmetric codes, we show that these dynamic black holes can be\naccurately evolved. In particular, we show that with present computational\nresources and techniques, the process of excitation and ringdown of the black\nhole can be evolved, and one can now extract accurately the gravitational waves\nemitted from the 3D Cartesian metric functions, even though they may be buried\nin the metric at levels on the order of $10^{-3}$ and below. Waveforms for both\nthe $\\ell=2$ and the much more difficult $\\ell=4$ modes are computed and\ncompared with axisymmetric calculations. In addition to exploring the physics\nof distorted black hole data sets, and showing the extent to which the waves\ncan be accurately extracted, these results also provide important testbeds for\nall fully nonlinear numerical codes designed to evolve black hole spacetimes in\n3D, whether they use singularity avoiding slicings, apparent horizon boundary\nconditions, or other evolution methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Sep 1997 19:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-08"}
