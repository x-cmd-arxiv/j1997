Fragmentation functions are extracted from fits to data\nof inclusive pion and kaon production in e^+e^- annihilation at different\ncentre-of-mass energies. Exploiting sensitivity to the scaling violation, one\ncan simultaneously fit the asymptotic scale parameter Lambda so as to obtain an\nindependent determination of the strong coupling constant alpha_s. Owing to the\nfactorization theorem, the fragmentation functions only depend on the species\nof the produced particles, but not on the process by which they are produced.\nThis allows one to make absolute theoretical predictions for inclusive pion and\nkaon production in other types of experiments such as photon-photon,\nphoton-hadron, or hadron-hadron scattering. Recent data of photoproduction\ntaken by the H1 and ZEUS Collaborations at DESY HERA nicely agree with such\nnext-to-leading-order predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 1997 15:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
