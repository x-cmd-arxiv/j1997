The main cases of initial conditions are:\n(i) 50 equal mass galaxies; (ii) 60 galaxies with masses drawn from a Schechter\ndistribution function, and (iii) the collision of two subclusters each one\ncontaining 25 galaxies. The evolution and kinematics of the first ranked\ngalaxy, the substructures, and the possible rotation of clusters are\ninvestigated. A massive object with cD characteristics is always formed and is\nnever found farther than 100 kpc from the centre of the cluster. This massive\ngalaxy oscillates around the cluster centre with an average peculiar velocity\nof 70 km s$^{-1}$. We show that increasing the initial intra-cluster medium\n(ICM) mass while keeping the galaxies mass and structure without change, raises\nthe merging rate due to the dynamical friction with the ICM. Substructures are\nalmost always present on the galaxy count contour plots. The ICM projected\ndensity, which should be similar to the X-ray emission map, presents strong\nsubstructures when we have colliding subclusters. Otherwise, in isolated\nclusters, the substructure is less pronounced indicating that substructures\nshould reflect important but transient dynamical phenomena. We propose that\nclusters formed by an off-centre collision and subsequent merging of two\napproximate equal mass subclusters should show a general rotational pattern\nthat could be detected even after the relaxation of the cluster. These clusters\nwould have a spin parameter, $\\lambda$, of about 0.3-0.5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 1997 16:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
