This parser\nis developed for the OVIS system: a Dutch spoken dialogue system in which\ninformation about public transport can be obtained by telephone.\n  After a review of the motivation for head-driven parsing strategies, and\nhead-corner parsing in particular, a non-deterministic version of the\nhead-corner parser is presented. A memoization technique is applied to obtain a\nfast parser. A goal-weakening technique is introduced which greatly improves\naverage case efficiency, both in terms of speed and space requirements.\n  I argue in favor of such a memoization strategy with goal-weakening in\ncomparison with ordinary chart-parsers because such a strategy can be applied\nselectively and therefore enormously reduces the space requirements of the\nparser, while no practical loss in time-efficiency is observed. On the\ncontrary, experiments are described in which head-corner and left-corner\nparsers implemented with selective memoization and goal weakening outperform\n`standard' chart parsers. The experiments include the grammar of the OVIS\nsystem and the Alvey NL Tools grammar.\n  Head-corner parsing is a mix of bottom-up and top-down processing. Certain\napproaches towards robust parsing require purely bottom-up processing.\nTherefore, it seems that head-corner parsing is unsuitable for such robust\nparsing techniques. However, it is shown how underspecification (which arises\nvery naturally in a logic programming environment) can be used in the\nhead-corner parser to allow such robust parsing techniques. A particular robust\nparsing model is described which is implemented in OVIS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 1997 14:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
