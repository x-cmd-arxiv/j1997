Two objects in our sample, namely\nHHJ6 and PPl15, are overluminous compared to other members, suggesting probable\nbinarity. We have reproduced the photometric measurements of both of them by\ncombining the magnitudes of cluster VLM stars and BDs and using the most recent\ntheoretical evolutionary tracks.

These ghosts violate basic theorems of quantum\nfield theory and their origin is related to the ultraviolet behavior of the\nmodel interactions. Recently, Krein et.al, proved that the ghosts disappear\nwhen vertex corrections are included in a self-consistent way, softening the\ninteraction sufficiently in the ultraviolet region. In previous studies of\npion-nucleon scattering using \"dressed\" nucleon propagator and bare vertices,\ndid by Nutt and Wilets in the 70's (NW), it was found that if these poles are\nexplicitly included, the value of the isospin-even amplitude A+ is satisfied\nwithin 20% at threshold. The absence of a theoretical explanation for the\nghosts and the lack of chiral symmetry in these previous studies led us to\nre-investigate the subject using the approach of the linear-sigma model and\nstudy the interplay of low-energy theorems for pion-nucleon scattering and\nghost poles. For bare interaction vertices we find that ghosts are present in\nthis model as well and that the A+ value is badly described. As a first\napproach to remove these complex poles, we dress the vertices with\nphenomenological form factors and a reasonable agreement with experiment is\nachieved. In order to fix the two cutoff parameters, we use the A+ value for\nthe chiral limit (m_pion -> 0) and the experimental value of the isoscalar\nscattering length.

First we estimate the minimum number of scanning phases needed to\nreduce systematic errors below a fixed threshold. Then, we calculate the\nstatistical errors, intrinsic in the procedure that gives the density matrix.\nWe present a detailed study of such errors versus the detectors quantum\nefficiency $\\eta$ and the matrix indexes in the number representation, for\ndifferent radiation states. For unit quantum efficiency, and for both coherent\nand squeezed states, the statistical errors of the diagonal matrix elements\nsaturate for large n. On the contrary, off-diagonal errors increase with the\ndistance from the diagonal. For non unit quantum efficiency the statistical\nerrors along the diagonal do not saturate, and increase dramatically versus\nboth $1-\\eta$ and the matrix indexes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 1997 15:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
