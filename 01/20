The trend between variability and luminosity is\ndescribed by a power-law with an index -0.08, which is incompatible with the\npower-law of index -1/2 predicted by the most general discrete-event models in\nwhich the change in average luminosity is due to differences in average event\nrates exclusively.

The latter possibility cannot produce a satisfactory relationship.\nUsing the former possibilities, we do not find any \"natural\" explanation for\nthe variability- luminosity relationship in the context of discrete-event\nmodels.
