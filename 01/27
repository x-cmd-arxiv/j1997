The ground based interferometers can have huge\napertures, which are necessary for faint cosmological targets. But, alone, they\nare limited to astrometry within the isoplanatic patch, and hence to relative\npositions, which are of little use for parallaxes and proper motions because\nreference stars have unknown parallaxes and huge (500 \\mu arcsec) unknown\nmotions. We propose that space missions should measure global astrometric\nparallaxes and proper motions for (V > 16) reference stars within the\nisoplanatic patches of important cosmological and Galactic targets. Ground\nbased interferometers can then measure absolute distances (parallaxes) and\nproper motions to 10 \\mu arcsec, tied to these reference stars. But\ncosmological observations stretch the VLTI technically. To observe the few best\ntargets, we need to be able to measure positions to < 10 \\mu arcsec over a\nlarge portion of the sky. Since natural guide stars are too far apart, or too\nfaint, laser guide stars are needed to correct the wavefronts of the individual\n8-m unit telescopes, and the fringe tracking system must have an extremely high\nthroughput to work on the brightest stars (V > 16) near to important targets.\nMost of the science is at 1 --2 microns, where excellent adaptive optics will\nbe needed on the 8-m telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 1997 19:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
