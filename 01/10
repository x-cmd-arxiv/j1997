In agreement with Rauch, Haehnelt & Steinmetz\n(1996), we find that the observed mean value of the CIV/HI ratio around z=3 is\nreproduced if a uniform metallicity of [C/H] = -2.5 is assumed in our model,\nbut that the observed scatter in this ratio is larger than predicted, implying\na scatter in the metallicity of the absorbing systems of roughly an order of\nmagnitude. We further argue that absorbers with relatively low column densities\n(log(N_HI) < 15) likely have a mean metallicity [C/H] less than -2.5, a result\nwhich is basically independent of the model considered, and similar to what is\npredicted in the simulations by Gnedin & Ostriker (1997). Our model predicts no\nsignificant evolution in the mean values of metal line column densities between\nz=3.5 and z=2. Comparison of the predicted and observed numbers of SiIV and NV\nsystems suggests that the photoionizing background radiation field around z=3\nis somewhat softer than that proposed by Haardt & Madau (1996). Our model does\nnot account for the increase in the SiIV/CIV ratio at z=3.2 found by SC. While\nSC suggested that the increase could be explained by a softening of the\nradiation field due to HeII absorption at z > 3, such a modification does not\nraise the mean value of SiIV/CIV in our simulation because it shifts numerous\nweak SiIV systems to just above the detection limit, thus keeping the mean\ncolumn density of observable SiIV systems low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 1997 22:18:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Our second system consists of competing\nannihilation and fission processes, 2A->0 and 2A->(n+2)A, a model which\nexhibits a transition between active and absorbing phases. However, this\ntransition and the active phase are not accessible to perturbative methods, as\nthe field theory describing these reactions is shown to be non-renormalisable.\nThis corresponds to the fact that there is no stationary state in the active\nphase, where the particle density diverges at finite times. We discuss the\nimplications of our analysis for a recent study of another active / absorbing\ntransition in a system with multiplicative noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 1997 10:01:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 1997 09:24:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 1997 08:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
