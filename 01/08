During the state transitions flux variations of about a factor of 5 and\n15 were seen in the 1.3-3.0 keV and 100-200 keV bands, respectively, while the\naverage 4.8-12 keV flux remains almost unchanged. The net effect of this\npivoting is that the total 1.3-200 keV luminosity remained unchanged to within\nabout 15%. The bolometric luminosity in the soft state may be as high as 50-70%\nabove the hard state luminosity, after color corrections for the luminosity\nbelow 1.3 keV.

The\nAffleck-Dine mechanism for baryogenesis is one of the possibilities to generate\nenough baryon asymmetry, but the analysis is non-trivial since the shape of the\npotential for the flat direction differs substantially from the conventional\nhidden sector case.
