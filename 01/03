A differential dynamical behaviour\ndepending on cluster richness is found compared to de la Fuente Marcos (1996a).\nThe evolution of these realistic models is very dependent on the initial mass\nfunction. Even for rich clusters, there is a dependence on the binary mass\nspectrum. The velocity distribution of the escapers is examined and compared\nwith results from previous calculations. The evolution of the primordial binary\npopulation is analyzed in detail. The cluster remnant and the final binary\npopulation are also studied.

At large external momentum p (or small mass M) and large\norder N one might expect perturbative bare skeleton graphs to behave roughly\nlike $N!(ag^2/p)^N$ with a>0, so that no matter how large p is there is an\n$N\\sim g^2/p$ giving rise to strong perturbative amplitudes. The semi-\nclassical Lipatov technique (which works only in the presence of a mass) is\nblind to this momentum dependence, so we proceed by direct summation of bare\nskeleton graphs. We find that the various limits of large N, large p, and small\nM do not commute, and that when $N\\gg p^2/M^2$ there is a Borel singularity\nassociated with $g^2/M$, not $g^2/p$. This is described by the zero-momentum\nLipatov technique, and we find the necessary soliton for $\\phi^3_5$; the\ncorresponding sphaleron-like solution for unbroken Yang-Mills theory has long\nbeen known. We also show that the massless theories have no classical solitons.\nWe discuss non-perturbative effects based partly on known physical arguments\nconcerning the cancellation by solitons of imaginary parts due to the pert-\nurbative Borel singularity, and partly on the dressing of bare skeleton graphs\nby dressed propagators showing non-perturbative mass generation, as happens in\nd=3 gauge theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 1997 18:43:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
