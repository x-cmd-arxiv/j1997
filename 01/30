The\ngenerating ideal of the wedge relations is given and the wedge space defined.\nNormal ordering of wedges is defined in terms of the energy function. Normally\nordered wedges form a base of the wedge space.\n  The q-deformed Fock space is defined as the space of semi-infinite wedges\nwith a finite number of vectors in the wedge product differing from a ground\nstate sequence, and endowed with a separated q-adic topology . Normally ordered\nwedges form a base of the Fock space. The action of $\\U_q(\\affsl{2})$ on the\nFock space converges in the q-adic topology. On the Fock space the action of\nbosons, which commute with the $\\U_q(\\affsl{2})$-action, also converges in the\nq-adic topology. Hence follows the decomposition of the Fock space into\nirreducible $\\U_q(\\affsl{2})$-modules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 1997 10:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
