Because the Mg absorption\ndepends on both metallicity and age of the underlying stellar population the\nobserved Mg-sigma relation constrains the possible variation in metallicity and\nage for a given velocity dispersion. For a time interval with no change in\nmetallicity any variation of the Mg index is caused only by the aging of the\nstars.\n  We have measured the Mg absorption and velocity dispersion of ellipticals in\nthree clusters at a redshift of z=0.37 and established their Mg-sigma relation.\nFor any given sigma, the measured Mg absorption is weaker than the mean value\nfor local ellipticals. Since the evolution of bright cluster ellipticals\nbetween z=0.4 and today is most probably only `passive' this reduction in Mg\ncan be attributed solely to the younger age of the stellar population. The\nsmall weakening of the Mg absorption of the distant galaxies compared to the\nlocal values implies that most of the stars in cluster ellipticals must have\nformed at high redshifts (z_f > 2...4).\n  The Mg-sigma test is a very robust method to investigate the evolution of\nelliptical galaxies and has several advantages over traditional methods using\nluminosities. A remaining problem is the aperture correction necessary to\ncalibrate observations of galaxies at different distances.

If the\ncharacteristic length scale of the Eulerian velocities is not very small\ncompared with the size of the basin the usual diffusion coefficient does not\ngive any relevant information about the mechanism of spreading.\n  We introduce a finite size characteristic time $\\tau(\\delta)$ which describes\nthe diffusive process at scale $\\delta$. When $\\delta$ is small compared with\nthe typical length of the velocity field one has $\\tau(\\delta) \\sim\n\\lambda^{-1}$, where $\\lambda$ is the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the\nLagrangian motion. At large $\\delta$ the behavior of $\\tau(\\delta)$ depends on\nthe details of the system, in particular the presence of boundaries, and in\nthis limit we have found a universal behavior for a large class of system under\nrather general hypothesis.\n  The method of working at fixed scale $\\delta$ makes more physical sense than\nthe traditional way of looking at the relative diffusion at fixed delay times.\nThis technique is displayed in a series of numerical experiments in simple\nflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 1997 10:27:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 1997 11:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The production rate for glueballs in $\\psi \\to \\gamma G$ has been\nquantified and the $f_0(1500)$ is found to be consistent with a glueball -\n$q\\bar{q}$ mixture. We illustrate a remarkable property of central production\nwhere kinematic cuts appear to make a systematic separation between glueballs\nand $q\\bar{q}$ of the same $J^{PC}$. When the cut favouring glueballs is\napplied, the $f_0(1500)$ and other enigmatic states appear prominently while\nconfirmed $q\\bar{q}$ states are empirically suppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 1997 16:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
