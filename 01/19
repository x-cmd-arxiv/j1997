These systems are almost\nexclusively on-going mergers. In this review I explore the conditions needed\nfor interactions to experience such a phase by comparing two systems at similar\nstages of merging but quite different IR luminosities: NGC 4038/9 and Arp 299.\nThese observations show that the most intense starbursts occur at the sites\nwith the highest gas densities, which is a general result for IR luminous\nmergers. Observations and theory both suggest that the strength of the merger\ninduced starburst depends on the internal structure of the progenitors, the\namount and distribution of the gas, and the violence of the interaction. In\nparticular, interactions involving progenitors with dense bulges, gas-rich\ndisks, and/or a retrograde spin are expected to preferentially lead to large\namounts of gaseous dissipation, although the interplay between these parameters\nis unknown. A major outstanding question is how the effects of feedback alter\nthese conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 1997 03:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

In this paper we present an extensive analysis of the\nsimplest (non-trivial) case of n=3 in the isotropic sector. The main parameter\nof the model, denoted as $\\zeta_h$, characterizes the eddy diffusivity and can\ntake values in the interval $0\\le \\zeta_h \\le 2$. After choosing appropriate\nvariables we can present computer-assisted non-perturbative calculations of the\nzero modes in a projective two dimensional circle. In this presentation it is\nalso very easy to perform perturbative calculations of the scaling exponent\n$\\zeta_3$ of the zero modes in the limit $\\zeta_h\\to 0$, and we display\nquantitative agreement with the non-perturbative calculations in this limit.\nAnother interesting limit is $\\zeta_h\\to 2$. This second limit is singular, and\ncalls for a study of a boundary layer using techniques of singular perturbation\ntheory. Our analysis of this limit shows that the scaling exponent $\\zeta_3$\nvanishes like $\\sqrt{\\zeta_2/log{\\zeta_2}}$. In this limit as well,\nperturbative calculations are consistent with the non-perturbative\ncalculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 1997 17:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
