While there has been some progress using statistical or\nconnectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use\na relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic\ncomponent. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning\nrobust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a\nflat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for\nanalyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather\nthan using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist\nanalysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language\nprocessing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of\nconnectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the\nSCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis.

Following Shor's result that\nfactoring and the extraction of discrete logarithms are both solvable in\nquantum polynomial time, it is natural to ask whether all of NP can be\nefficiently solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we address this\nquestion by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random, with\nprobability 1, the class NP cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine in\ntime $o(2^{n/2})$. We also show that relative to a permutation oracle chosen\nuniformly at random, with probability 1, the class $NP \\cap coNP$ cannot be\nsolved on a quantum Turing machine in time $o(2^{n/3})$. The former bound is\ntight since recent work of Grover shows how to accept the class NP relative to\nany oracle on a quantum computer in time $O(2^{n/2})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 1997 13:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-26"}
