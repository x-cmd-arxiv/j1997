In the present paper, we propose that this rapid decay of\naccretion/ejection activity is a direct result of the non-singular density\nprofiles characterizing pre-collapse clouds. The radial density profiles of\npre-stellar cores are indeed found to be much flatter than rho(r) ~ r(-2) at\nradii less than a few thousand AU (Ward-Thompson et al. 1994). Here we show,\nthrough Lagrangian analytical calculations, that the supersonic gravitational\ncollapse of pre-stellar cloud cores with centrally peaked, but flattened\ndensity profiles leads to a transitory phase of energetic accretion immediately\nfollowing the formation of the central hydrostatic protostar. Physically, the\nflat inner region collapses first nearly homologously to form a finite mass\nstellar nucleus, and the remaining cloud core material then accretes\nsupersonically onto a non-zero point mass. Enhanced accretion persists as long\nas the gravitational pull of this initial point mass, which does not exist in\nthe Shu singular solution, remains significant. We suggest that this epoch of\nvigorous accretion coincides with Class 0 protostars, which would explain their\nunusually powerful jets compared to the more evolved Class I objects. We also\nuse a simple two-component power-law model to fit the diagrams of outflow power\nversus envelope mass observed by Bontemps et al.

This probability is proportional to the fraction of matter which is\ndestined to condense out of the background into mass concentrations large\nenough to form observers. We calculate this ``collapsed fraction'' by a simple,\npressure-free, spherically symmetric, nonlinear model for the growth of density\nfluctuations in a flat universe with arbitrary value of the cosmological\nconstant, applied in a statistical way to the observed spectrum of density\nfluctuations at recombination. From this, the probability distribution for the\nvacuum energy density rho_V=Lambda/8pi G for Gaussian random density\nfluctuations is derived analytically. It is shown that the results depend on\nonly one quantity, sigma^3 RHO, where sigma^2 and RHO are the variance and mean\nvalue of the fluctuating matter density field at recombination, respectively.\nTo calculate sigma, we adopt the flat CDM model with nonzero cosmological\nconstant and fix the amplitude and shape of the primordial power spectrum in\naccordance with data on cosmic microwave background anisotropy from the COBE\nsatellite DMR experiment. A comparison of the results of this calculation of\nthe likely values of rho_V with present observational bounds on the\ncosmological constant indicates that the small, positive value of rho_V (up to\n3 times greater than the present cosmic mass density) suggested recently by\nseveral lines of evidence is a reasonably likely value to observe, even if all\nvalues of rho_V are equally likely a priori.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 1997 20:21:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The most popular Single Phase Transition Model\n(SPTM) assumes that the new phase is the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) consisting of\ndeconfined, chiral symmetric, pointlike \"current\" quarks q and gluons g of\nQuantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This paper is devoted to another, Double Phase\nTransition Model (DPTM) according to which hadronic substance (H) and QGP\ntransform one into another via an intermediate phase consisting of deconfined\nconstituent massive quarks Q which for brevity sake we call also equivalently\nvalons (Q, valonic phase) with broken chiral symmetry (plus pions as Goldstone\nparticles). I. e. we consider the phase transformation chain H-Q-QGP instead of\nusually assumed H-QGP. The phase transition H-Q is the Hagedorn one and\ncorresponds to the Hagedorn temperature. Connection with the relativistic heavy\nion collision is discussed. H-Q transformation may take place even at low (e.g.\nDubna) energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 1997 12:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
