Submitted to ApJ","journal-ref":null,"doi":"10.1086/304893","report-no":null,"categories":"astro-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  We derive analytic lower bounds on the cosmic baryon density by requiring\nthat the high-redshift IGM contain enough neutral hydrogen to produce the\nobserved \\lya absorption in quasar spectra. The key theoretical assumption is\nthat absorbing structures are no more extended in redshift space than in real\nspace. This assumption might not hold if \\lya clouds are highly overdense and\nthermally broadened, but it is likely to hold in the gravitational instability\npicture for the \\lya forest suggested by cosmological simulations,\nindependently of the details of the cosmological model. The other ingredients\nin these bounds are an estimate of the UV background from quasars, a\ntemperature $T~10^4K$ for the \"warm\" photoionized IGM that produces most of the\n\\lya absorption, a value of the Hubble constant, and observational estimates of\nthe mean \\lya flux decrement $\\Dbar$ or, for a more restrictive bound, the\ndistribution function $P(\\tau)$ of \\lya optical depths. With plausible\nparameter values, the mean decrement bound implies a baryon density parameter\n$\\Omb \\ga 0.0125/h^2$. With conservative values, the bound weakens to $\\Omb \\ga\n0.005/h^2$, but the required clustering of the IGM is then incompatible with\nother properties of quasar spectra. A recent observational determination of\n$P(\\tau)$ implies $\\Omb \\ga 0.0125/h^2$ even for a conservative estimate of the\nUV background, and $\\Omb \\ga 0.018/h^2$ for a more reasonable estimate. These\nbounds are consistent with recent low estimates of the primordial\ndeuterium-to-hydrogen ratio $\\dtoh$, which imply $\\Omb \\approx 0.025/h^2$, but\nthe $P(\\tau)$ bound can only be reconciled with high $\\dtoh$ estimates by\nabandoning standard big bang nucleosynthesis or the gravitational instability\npicture for the origin of the \\lya forest.
