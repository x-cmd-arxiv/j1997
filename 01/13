To study how this influences the overall stability, first we\nderive an analytic dispersion relation for cooling media, separated by a shear\nlayer. The inclusion of dissipation does not heal the instability, but it is\nshown that only a small volume around the interface is affected, the\nperturbation decaying exponentially with distance from the surface; this is\nconfirmed by numerical simulations.

We show that the hermiticity and nilpotency of the\nBRST charge together with the Batalin-Vilkovisky theorem yield non-trivial\nsupplementary conditions on gauge fixing fermions. If the gauge fixing fermion\nsatisfies the supplementary conditions, the BRST physical states form a space\nisomorphic to the Dirac space, and the BRST formal path integral does not\nsuffer from the Gribov problem. The conventional gauge fixing fermion, that\ngives rise to the Faddeev-Popov integral, fails to satisfy the supplementary\nconditions due to the Gribov problem. Alternatively, enforcing the conventional\ngauge fixing fermion, these supplementary conditions imply restrictions on the\nBRST physical states for which the Batalin-Vilkovisky theorem holds. We find\nthat these BRST physical states are not isomorphic the Dirac states. This can\nbe interpreted as a violation of the Batalin-Vilkovisky theorem on the space of\nDirac states and implies a breakdown of unitarity and a general dependence of\nphysical quantities on the gauge condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 1997 13:19:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 1997 11:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
