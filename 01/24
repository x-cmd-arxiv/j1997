The spectrum of photons produced throughout the\nphase transition is a non- equilibrium one. For thermal initial conditions at\nthe time of the quench it interpolates between a thermal distribution about 6%\nabove the initial temperature (at the time of the quench) for low energy $\\leq\n80$ MeV photons, and a high energy tail in thermal equilibrium at the initial\ntemperature, with a smooth crossover at 100 MeV.

It is shown that in a\ncertain region of parameter space these solutions are unstable, with the\ninstability being manifested as a small positive eigenvalue. Furthermore, it is\nshown that in the complimentary region of parameter space there are no small\nunstable eigenvalues. The proof involves a novel calculation of the Evans\nfunction, which is of interest in its own right. As a consequence of the\neigenvalue calculation, it is additionally shown that N-bump bright solitary\nwaves bifurcate from the primary wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 1997 21:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
