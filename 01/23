Nonlinear structures in redshift space such as fingers of\nGod can contaminate distortions from linear flows on scales as large as several\ntimes the small-scale pairwise velocity dispersion sigma_v. Following Peacock &\nDodds (1994), we work in the Fourier domain and propose a model to describe the\nanisotropy in the redshift-space power spectrum; tests with high-resolution\nnumerical data demonstrate that the model is robust for both mass and biased\ngalaxy halos on translinear scales and above. On the basis of this model, we\npropose an estimator of the linear growth parameter beta = Omega^0.6/b, where b\nmeasures bias, derived from sampling functions which are tuned to eliminate\ndistortions from nonlinear clustering. The measure is tested on the numerical\ndata and found to recover the true value of beta to within ~10%. An analysis of\nthe IRAS 1.2Jy galaxies yields beta = 0.8+0.4/-0.3 at a scale of 1,000 km/s\nwhich is close to optimal given the shot noise and the finite survey volume.\nThis measurement is consistent with dynamical estimates of beta derived from\nboth real-space and redshift-space information.

The field dynamics\ncan depend in principle on the geometry and topology of the vacuum manifold\nG/H; for example, texture configurations which collapse and unwind will exist\nif the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(G/H)$ is nontrivial. We numerically simulate\nthe evolution of texture-like configurations in a number of different models,\nin order to determine the extent to which the geometry and topology of the\nvacuum manifold influences the field evolution. We find that the dynamics is\naffected by whether or not the theory supports strings or monopoles\n[characterized by $\\pi_1(G/H)$ and $\\pi_2(G/H)$, respectively]. In some of the\ntheories studied, configurations with initially spherically symmetric energy\ndensities are unstable to nonspherical collapse; these theories are also found\nto nucleate defects during the collapse.
