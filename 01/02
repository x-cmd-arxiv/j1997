The response of the system to virus involves a competition between\nthe ability of the virus to kill the host cells and the host's ability to\neliminate the virus. We find two basins of attraction in the dynamics of this\nsystem, one is identified with disease and the other with the immune state.\nThere is also an oscillating state that exists on the border of these two\nstable states. Fluctuations in the population of virus or antibody can end the\noscillation and drive the system into one of the stable states. The\nintroduction of mechanisms of cross-regulation between the two responses can\nbias the system towards one of them. We also study a mean field model, based on\ncoupled maps, to investigate virus-like infections. This simple model\nreproduces the attractors for average populations observed in the cellular\nautomaton. All the dynamical behavior connected to spatial extension is lost,\nas is the oscillating feature. Thus the mean field approximation introduced\nwith coupled maps destroys oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 1997 13:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
