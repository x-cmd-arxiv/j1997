Phonon-induced Van Hove nesting leads to a phase separation between a\nhole-doped domain and a (magnetic) domain near half filling, with long-range\nCoulomb forces limiting the separation to a nanoscopic scale. Strong\ncorrelation effects pin the Fermi level close to, but not precisely at the Van\nHove singularity (VHS), which can enhance the tendency to phase separation. The\nresulting dispersions have been calculated, both in the uniform phases and in\nthe phase separated regime. In the latter case, distinctly different\ndispersions are found for large, random domains and for regular (static)\nstriped arrays, and a hypothetical form is presented for dynamic striped\narrays. The doping dependence of the latter is found to provide an excellent\ndescription of photoemission and thermodynamic experiments on pseudogap\nformation in underdoped cuprates. In particular, the multiplicity of observed\ngaps is explained as a combination of flux phase plus charge density wave (CDW)\ngaps along with a superconducting gap. The largest gap is associated with VHS\nnesting. The apparent smooth evolution of this gap with doping masks a\ncrossover from CDW-like effects near optimal doping to magnetic effects (flux\nphase) near half filling.
