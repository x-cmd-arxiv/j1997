Such pancakes are modeled here, approximating the\ninitial perturbation leading to the formation of the pancake as a single\nsinusoidal wave. The density and temperature profiles of the gas in the pancake\nare determined for $z_c \\sim 3$, where $z_c$ is the collapse redshift. The\n$\\lyal$ absorption line profiles for a line of sight through the pancake are\nthen calculated. The absorption lines in general have wings signifying bulk\nmotions in the gas. It is shown that the deviation from a single Voigt profile\nis large for small H I column density lines, in which the effect of bulk\nmotions is large.

The analytical modeling of mini\npancakes associated with $\\lyal$ forest lines --- with $10^{13} \\la \\nha \\la\n10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$---gives the corresponding mass scales.

Analytical results are obtained by perturbation\ntheory in the limit $\\sigma_{xx} \\gg 1$. For mesoscopic systems the conduction\nprocess is dominated by diffusion but we show that, due to the lack of\ntime-reversal symmetry, the boundary condition for diffusion is altered at the\nreflecting edges. Instead of the usual condition, that the derivative along the\ndirection normal to the wall of the diffusing variable vanishes, the derivative\nat the Hall angle to the normal vanishes. We demonstrate the origin of this\nboundary condition from different starting points, using (i) a simplified\nChalker-Coddington network model, (ii) the standard diagrammatic perturbation\nexpansion, and (iii) the nonlinear sigma-model with the topological term, thus\nestablishing connections between the different approaches. Further boundary\neffects are found in quantum interference phenomena.

Thus the conductance fluctuations are no longer\nsimply described by the unitary universality class of the $\\sigma_{xy}=0$ case,\nbut instead there is a one-parameter family of probability distributions. In\nthe quasi-one-dimensional limit, the usual universal result for the conductance\nfluctuations of the unitary ensemble is recovered, in contrast to results of\nprevious authors.

Such a transformation is\nimplementable by a Hilbert space of isometries if and only if the well-known\nShale-Stinespring condition is met. In this case, the dimension of the\nimplementing Hilbert space equals the square root of the Watatani index of the\nassociated inclusion of CAR algebras, and both are determined by the Fredholm\nindex of the corresponding one-particle operator. Explicit expressions for the\nimplementing operators are obtained, and the connected components of the\nsemigroup of implementable transformations are described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 1997 18:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-06"}
