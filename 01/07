In earlier\nwork we found that, for weak inter-layer coupling, it is preferable for\nelectrons to travel along the c axis by making a series of interband\ntransitions rather than to stay within a single (and very narrow) band.\nMoreover, we found that many of the properties of the normal state optical\nconductivity, including the pseudogap could be explained by interband\ntransitions. In this work we examine the effect of superconductivity on the\ninterband conductivity.

We critically review the various mechanisms that have been\nsuggested to solve these problems: exact universality, approximate CP symmetry,\nalignment, approximate universality and heavy squarks. We explain how future\nmeasurements of CP violation will test these mechanisms. We describe extensions\nof the quark sector and their implications on CP asymmetries in neutral B\ndecays, on the $K_L \\to \\pi \\nu \\bar\\nu$ decay and on $\\Delta\\Gamma(B_s)$. We\ndiscuss CP violation in charged scalar exchange in models with natural flavor\nconservation and explain how transverse lepton polarization in meson decays can\nprobe such models. CP violation in neutral scalar exchange arises in models of\nhorizontal symmetries and may be manifest in heavy quark (b and t) physics. We\ndescribe the implications of Left-Right Symmetric models on $d_N$,\n$\\epsilon_K$, $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ and CP asymmetries in B decays.

More realistic calculations, such as\nthose performed in the random-phase approximation framework, give rise to a\nmixing of one particle-one hole configurations of both kinds which reduce these\neffects. However, it has been found that the excitation of some of these levels\nis sizeably affected by the meson-exchange contribution. More precise\nexperimental data concerning some of these states, such as e.g. the high-spin\nstates in 208Pb, could throw some light in the problem of a more feasible\ndetermination of these effects and, as a consequence, could provide an\nalternative procedure to obtain the charge neutron form factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 1997 10:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The general\nmethod is applied for degrees 8,12 and 14 for which 2,8 and 19 invariant\npolinomials are obtained respectively. For each particular degree, these\ninvariant polinomials can be taken to be $E_8$ basis functions in the sense\nthat any Casimir operator of $E_8$ has always eigenvalues which can be\nexpressed as linear superpositions of them.
