Despite the\ndirect coupling, the models preserve perturbative unification of the SM gauge\ncoupling constants. Furthermore, the supergravity contributions to the squark\nand slepton masses can be naturally small, typically being much less than 1% of\nthe gauge mediated contributions. Both of these goals can be achieved without\nneed of a fine-tuning or a very small coupling constant. This scheme requires\nrun-away directions at the renormalizable level which are only lifted by\nnon-renormalizable terms in the superpotential. To study the proposed scheme in\npractice, we develop a modified class of models based on $SU(N)\\times SU(N-1)$\nwhich allows us to gauge a $SU(N-2)$ global symmetry. However, we point out a\nnew problem which can exist in models where the dynamical supersymmetry\nbreaking sector and the ordinary sector are directly coupled -- the two-loop\nrenormalization group has contributions which can induce negative $(mass)^2$\nfor the squarks and sleptons. We clarify the origin of the problem and argue\nthat it is likely to be surmountable.
