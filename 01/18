We find that in all cases the ASCA\nspectra can be described by a canonical model consisting of a power-law with a\nphoton index ~ 1.7-2.0, plus a soft optically thin emission component with kT ~\n0.6-0.8 keV. The implied element abundances are often sub-solar. The soft\ncomponent is usually extended and the nuclear, point-like emission is sometimes\nabsorbed by column densities in the range log nH ~ 21-23 cm-2. The relative\nluminosities of the soft and hard components vary from galaxy to galaxy. For\nthe LINERs, the 2-10 keV luminosity of the hard component is typically log L ~\n40-41 ergs/s whereas the 0.5-2.0 keV luminosity of the soft component is\ntypically log L ~ 39-40 ergs/s. For starbursts, the 2-10 keV luminosity of is\nlog L ~ 39-40 ergs/s, somewhat lower than the corresponding luminosity of most\nof the LINERs in our sample. The hard component is similar to the observed\nX-ray spectra of quasars and also to the intrinsic X-ray spectra of classical\nSeyfert galaxies. Most of the galaxies in our sample exhibit no significant\n(dI/I > 20%) short-term variability (with timescales of a day or less) whereas\nlong-term variability is common.
