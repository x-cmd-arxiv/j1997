It is expected that the tagging of specific particles in\nthe target fragments can be employed to introduce a bias in the hard scattering\nprocess towards a specific flavour content. The case of hadrons containing a\nheavy quark is particularly attractive because of the clear experimental\nsignatures and the applicability of perturbative QCD. The standard approach to\none-particle inclusive processes based on fragmentation functions is valid in\nthe current fragmentation region and for large transverse momenta $p_T$ in the\ntarget fragmentation region, but it fails for particle production at small\n$p_T$ in the target fragmentation region. A collinear singularity, which cannot\nbe absorbed in the standard way into the phenomenological distribution\nfunctions, prohibits the application of this procedure. This situation is\nremedied by the introduction of a new set of distribution functions, the target\nfragmentation functions. They describe particle production in the target\nfragmentation region, and can be viewed as correlated distribution functions in\nthe momentum fractions of the observed particle and of the parton initiating\nthe hard scattering process. It is shown in a next-to-leading-order calculation\nfor the case of deeply inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering that the additional\nsingularity can be consistently absorbed into the renormalized target\nfragmentation functions on the one-loop level. The formalism is derived in\ndetail and is applied to the production of heavy quarks. The renormalization\ngroup equation of the target fragmentation functions for the perturbative\ncontribution is solved numerically, and the results of a case study for deeply\ninelastic lepton-nucleon scattering at DESY (H1 and ZEUS at HERA), at CERN\n(NA47) and at Fermilab (E665) are discussed. We also comment briefly on the\ncase of an intrinsic heavy-quark content of the proton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 1997 07:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
