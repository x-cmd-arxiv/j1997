More precisely, we consider the subset of the\nmoduli space of Higgs bundles satisfying the analogous cohomological condition.\nWe show that this set is Zariski closed and that if Sigma is the normalization\nof an irreducible component containing a stable point, then a connected\ncomponent of a general fiber of the restriction of the Hitchin map to Sigma is\nan abelian variety. This should be interpreted as a nonabelian version of a\ntheorem of Green and Lazarsfeld. The Hitchin map in this setting is in fact\nSimpson's generalization of it. The key point is to show that the general\nfibers of this map are lagrangian (where the target of the map is taken to be\nthe image). This hinges on the fact that this property is essentially\nhereditary for hyperkaehler submanifolds. We establish various other properties\nof these sets including a codimension estimate which may be viewed as a generic\nvanishing theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 1997 14:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

By using a tree threaded at all levels, tree traversals for finding\nnearest neighbors are avoided. All operations on a tree including tree\nmodifications are O(N), where N is a number of cells, and are performed in\nparallel. An efficient implementation of the tree is described that requires 2N\nwords of memory. A filtering algorithm for removing high-frequency noise during\nmesh refinement is described.\n  A FTT can be used in various numerical applications. In this paper, it is\napplied to the integration of the Euler equations of fluid dynamics. An\nadaptive-mesh time stepping algorithm is described in which different time\nsteps are used at different levels of the tree. Time stepping and mesh\nrefinement are interleaved to avoid extensive buffer layers of fine mesh which\nwere otherwise required ahead of moving shocks. Test examples are presented,\nand the FTT performance is evaluated. The three-dimensional simulation of the\ninteraction of a shock wave and a spherical bubble is carried out that shows\nthe development of azimuthal perturbations on the bubble surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 1997 19:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
