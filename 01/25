It is purely bosonic, and cancellation of massless tadpoles requires\nthe gauge group to be SO(32)xSO(32). The spectrum of the theory contains a\nclosed string tachyon, and open string tachyons in the (32,32) multiplet. The\nD-branes of this theory are analyzed, and it is found that the massless\nexcitations of one of the 1-branes coincide with the world-sheet degrees of\nfreedom of the D=26 bosonic string theory compactified on the SO(32) lattice.\nThis suggests that the two theories are related by S-duality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 1997 22:34:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 May 1997 20:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

Interrelation to the\ntau-function method is discussed in detail. The principal result, which forms\nthe basis of our SEP method, is the proof that any eigenfunction of the general\nKP hierarchy can be represented as a spectral integral over the Baker-Akhiezer\n(BA) wave function with a spectral density expressed in terms of SEP. In fact,\nthe spectral representations of the (adjoint) BA functions can, in turn, be\nconsidered as defining equations for the KP hierarchy. The SEP method is\nsubsequently used to show how the reduction of the full KP hierarchy to the\nconstrained KP hierarchies can be given entirely in terms of linear constraint\nequations on the pertinent tau-functions. The concept of SEP turns out to be\ncrucial in providing a description of constrained KP hierarchies in the\nlanguage of universal Sato Grassmannian and finding the non-isospectral\nVirasoro symmetry generators acting on the underlying tau-functions. The SEP\nmethod is used to write down generalized binary Darboux-Backlund\ntransformations for constrained KP hierarchies whose orbits are shown to\ncorrespond to a new Toda model on a square lattice. As a result, we obtain a\nseries of new determinant solutions for the tau-functions generalizing the\nknown Wronskian (multi-soliton) solutions. Finally, applications to random\nmatrix models in condensed matter physics are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 1997 21:06:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 1997 14:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
