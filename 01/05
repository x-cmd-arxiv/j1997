From a high- resolution\nechelle spectrum of the same star obtained with the Hydra fiber positioner and\nbench spectrograph on the WIYN telescope, we measure a radial velocity of\n$-53.0\\pm1.2$ km s$^{-1}$. Although this velocity is inconsistent with\npublished estimates of the systemic radial velocity of M14 (eg, ${\\bar {v_r}}\n\\approx -123$ km s$^{-1}$), we use high-precision Hydra velocities for 20 stars\nin the central 2.6 arcminutes of M14 to calculate improved values for the\ncluster mean velocity and one-dimensional velocity dispersion: $-59.5\\pm1.9$ km\ns$^{-1}$ and $8.2\\pm1.4$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. Both the star's location\nnear the tip of the red giant branch in the cluster color magnitude diagram and\nits radial velocity therefore argue for membership in M14. Since the\nintermediate-resolution MOS spectrum shows not only enhanced CH absorption but\nalso strong Swan bands of C$_2$, M14 joins Omega Cen as the only globular\nclusters known to contain classical CH stars. Although evidence for its\nduplicity must await additional radial velocity measurements, the CH star in\nM14 is probably, like all field CH stars, a spectroscopic binary with a\ndegenerate (white dwarf) secondary. The candidate and confirmed CH stars in M14\nand Omega Cen, and in a number of Galactic dSph galaxies, may then owe their\nexistence to the long timescales for the shrinking and coalescence of hard\nbinaries in low-concentration environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 1997 21:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We use the T-Matrix equations below\n$T_c$, developed recently by the Z\\\"urich group (M.H. Pedersen et al) for the\nlocal pair attraction Hamiltonian. Here, we include as well the effect of\nfluctuations on the order parameter (beyond the BCS solution) up to second\norder in $U/t$. This is equivalent to approximating the effective interaction\nby $U$ in the off-diagonal self-energy. For $U/t = -6.0$, $T/t = 0.05$, $\\mu/t\n= - 5.5$ and $\\Delta/t = 1.5$, we find four peaks both for the diagonal,\n$A(n(\\pi/16,\\pi/16),\\omega)$, and off-diagonal, $B(n(\\pi/16,\\pi/16),\\omega)$,\nspectral functions. These peaks are not symmetric in pairs as previously found.\nIn addition: (a) in $A(n(\\pi/16,\\pi/16),\\omega)$, the far left peak has a\nvanishing small weight; (b) in $B(n(\\pi/16,\\pi/16),\\omega)$ the far left and\nfar right peaks have very small weights. The physical picture is, then, that\nthe pair physics in the normal phase ($T > T_c$) is still valid below $T_c$.\nHowever, the condensation of the e-h pairs produces an additional gap around\nthe chemical potential as in BCS, in other words, superconductivity opens a gap\nin the lower branch of a Hubbard-type-I solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 1997 14:39:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}
