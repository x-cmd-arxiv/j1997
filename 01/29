The implications of the results\nto experimental studies of He scattering from disordered surfaces are\ndiscussed, and a combined experimental-theoretical study is made for Ag\nsubmonolayers on Pt(111). Some of the main theoretical findings are: (1)\nStructural aspects of the calculated intensities from translationally random\nclusters were found to be strongly correlated with those of individual\nclusters. (2) Low intensity Bragg interference peaks appear even for scattering\nfrom very small ad-islands, and contain information on the ad-island local\nelectron structure. (3) For fractal islands, just as for islands with a\ndifferent structure, the off-specular intensity depends on the parameters of\nthe He/Ag interaction, and does not follow a universal power law as previously\nproposed in the literature.
