The entire period can be\ndivided into 3 distinct phases: (1) transition from the hard to soft state, (2)\nsoft state, and (3) transition from the soft state back to the hard state. The\nobserved X-ray properties in phases 1 and 3 are remarkably similar, suggesting\nthat the same physical processes are likely involved in triggering such\ntransitions. The power density spectrum (PDS) during the transition can be\ncharacterized by a red noise component, followed by a white noise component\nwhich extends to roughly 1-3 Hz where it is cut off, and a steeper power law at\nhigher frequencies. The X-ray flux also exhibits apparent quasi-periodic\noscillation (QPO) with the centroid frequency varying in the range of 4-12 Hz.\nThe QPO shows no correlation with the source flux, but becomes more prominent\nat higher energies. This type of PDS bears resemblance to that of other black\nhole candidates often observed in a so-called very high state, although the\norigin of the observed QPO may be very different. The low-frequency red noise\nhas not been observed in the hard state, thus seems to be positively correlated\nwith the disk mass accretion rate which is presumably low in the hard state and\nhigh in the soft state; in fact, it completely dominates the PDS in the soft\nstate.

The second is an amorphous structure with a minimum of wrong (homopolar)\nbonds, and therefore a minimum of odd-membered atomic rings, and thus\ncorresponds to the Connell-Temkin model. By comparing the structural,\nelectronic, and dynamical properties of these two models, we show that the\nConnell-Temkin network is energetically favored over Polk, but that most\nproperties are little affected by the differences in topology. We conclude that\nmost indirect experimental evidence for the presence (or absence) of wrong\nbonds is much weaker than previously believed and that only direct structural\nmeasurements, i.e., of such quantities as partial radial distribution\nfunctions, can provide quantitative information on these defects in a-GaAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 1997 17:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The Landauer Resistance (LR) and band spectra were determined for\nthe tight binding Hamiltonians associated with the GCQTM for energies both\nabove and below the potential height. For parameters and potentials in the\nelectron region, the LR fluctuates rapidly between very high and very low\nvalues as a function of momentum. The rapidity and extent of the fluctuations\nincreases rapidly with increasing N. For N=18, the largest value considered,\nthe LR shows good transmission probability as a function of momentum with\nnumerous holes of very high LR values present. This is true for energies above\nand below the potential height. It is suggested that the main features of the\nLR can be explained by coherent superposition of the component waves reflected\nfrom or transmitted through the $2^{N-1}$ potentials in the distribution. If\nthis explanation is correct, it provides a dramatic illustration of the effects\nof quantum nonlocality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 1997 15:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
