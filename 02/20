The mean\nbolometric temperature of the 16 sources with well-determined values is 44 K\nand the mean luminosity is 5.7 L_sun, excluding two sources of considerably\nhigher luminosity. Nine sources, including three sources previously suggested\nto be collapsing, have the correct (blue) spectral line asymmetry for infall in\nboth lines. Three sources have the opposite (red) asymmetry in both lines, and\none source, L1157, has a red asymmetry in HCO+ J=4-3 and a blue asymmetry in\nJ=3-2. The rest have no significant or consistent asymmetry. The H13CO+ J=4-3\nand 3-2 lines were also observed to find the velocity of the ambient gas, and\nsources with an interesting line asymmetry were mapped. A Monte Carlo code was\nused to produce an evolutionary sequence of collapsing cloud models of the HCO+\nJ=4-3 and 3-2 lines and to compare various diagnostics of the resulting line\nprofiles. The same code was used to compare infall models to the observations\nin one source, L1527. The results were consistent with previous collapse\nmodels. Based on integrated intensity maps of the line peaks and wings, as well\nas the velocity of the H13CO+ line, we select six of the nine sources with a\nblue line asymmetry as good candidates for protostellar collapse. Further\nevidence is needed to establish that infall is taking place. The HCO+ spectra\nare not conclusive because bipolar outflows produce strong emission, which can\nconfuse the issue in any individual source.

Quasilocal energy is\nthe value of the Hamiltonian that generates unit magnitude proper-time\ntranslations on the box orthogonal to the spatial hypersurfaces foliating the\nSchwarzschild spacetime. We call this Hamiltonian the Brown-York Hamiltonian.\nWe find different classes of foliations that correspond to time-evolution by\nthe Brown-York Hamiltonian. We show that although the Brown-York expression for\nthe quasilocal energy is correct, one needs to supplement their derivation with\nan extra set of boundary conditions on the interior end of the spatial\nhypersurfaces inside the hole in order to obtain it from an action principle.\nReplacing this set of boundary conditions with another set yields the\nLouko-Whiting Hamiltonian, which corresponds to time-evolution of spatial\nhypersurfaces in a different foliation of the Schwarzschild spacetime. We argue\nthat in the thermodynamical picture, the Brown-York Hamiltonian corresponds to\nthe internal energy whereas the Louko-Whiting Hamiltonian corresponds to the\nHelmholtz free energy of the system. Unlike what has been the usual route to\nblack hole thermodynamics in the past, this observation immediately allows us\nto obtain the partition function of such a system without resorting to any kind\nof Euclideanization of either the Hamiltonian or the action. In the process, we\nobtain some interesting insights into the geometrical nature of black hole\nthermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 1997 11:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}
