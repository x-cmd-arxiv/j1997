The\nsingle-center solutions can be also generated from the Schwarzschild solution\nby applying a sequence of boosts, dualities and taking the extremal limit.\nBasic `marginal' backgrounds representing threshold BPS bound states of branes\nare parametrised by a number of independent harmonic functions. `Non-marginal'\nBPS configurations in D=10 can be constructed from marginal ones by using\nU-duality and thus depend also on a number of O(d,d) and SL(2,R) parameters. We\npresent a new more general class of configurations in which some of the branes\nor their intersections are localised on other branes. In particular, we find\nthe type IIB supergravity background describing the BPS configuration of a\n3-brane, RR 5-brane and NS-NS 5-brane, and related `localised' 2-5-5 D=11\nsolution. We also consider the classical action for a 3-brane probe moving in\nsuch backgrounds and determine the structure of the corresponding moduli space\nmetrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 1997 00:26:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 May 1997 19:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}
