Since the\nhost galaxy seems to be a face-on disk galaxy and the excitation conditions of\nthe circumnuclear emission-line regions show the spatial symmetry, we consider\nthat we are seeing the superwind nearly from a pole-on view. Cooling shock\nmodels may explain the observed emission line ratios of the circumnuclear\nregions although a factor of 2 overabundance of nitrogen is necessary.
