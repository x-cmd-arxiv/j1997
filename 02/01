The\nASCA spectra of both M82 and NGC 253 are complex with strong line emission from\nO, Ne, Fe, Mg, S, and Si, allowing elemental abundances to be estimated in the\nX-ray band for the first time in these sources. Two components are required to\nfit the spectra of both galaxies, with a \"soft\" component well described by a\nthermal model with a temperature of ~ 10^6-7 K and a \"hard\" component well\ndescribed by either a thermal model (T ~ 10^8 K) or a power-law model (energy\nindex ~ 0.8-1.0). We find that different models (with different continua) yield\nabsolute abundances that differ by more than an order of magnitude, while\nrelative abundances are more robust and suggest an underabundance of Fe\n(inferred from the Fe-L complex) relative to alpha-burning elements, possibly\nas a result of dust depletion. Most of the soft flux (which originates mostly\nwithin the central kpc of M82 and NGC 253) is consistent with starburst models\nof supernovae-heated ISM and, to a lesser extent, starburst-driven superwind\nemission and the direct emission from supernova (SN). The hard component in\nboth galaxies may have some contribution from ~ 10^8 K superwind emission or\nindividual SN, although most of the emission probably originates in point\nsources (most likely blackhole candidates or mini-AGN with M_Edd > 3-20 solar\nmasses) and, possibly, inverse-Compton scattering of IR photons. The similarity\nof the spectral X-ray characteristics of NGC 253 and M82 to some LINERs and\nlow-luminosity AGN suggests a link between AGN and starbursts (e.g., both may\ncontain an accretion-driven emission component).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 1997 17:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

It consists in producing antihydrogen by circulating a beam of an\nantiproton ring through an internal gas target. In the Coulomb field of a\nnucleus, an electron-positron pair is created, and antihydrogen will form when\nthe positron is created in a bound rather that a continuum state about the\nantiproton.

The\nkernel of Schwinger's result is that the change in Casimir energy is\nproportional to the change in volume of the dielectric, plus finite-volume\ncorrections.
