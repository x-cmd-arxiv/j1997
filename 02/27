In order to see the global effect of\nthis type of connections, the case of M^1 embedded in R^3 is examined, where\nthe relation of an integral of the gauge potential of the N-connection (i.e.,\nthe torsion) along a path in M^1 to the Berry's phase is given through Gauss\nmapping of the vector tangent to M^1.

Compactly developing the\ncalculations with superoperators, it is shown that the introduction of a time\nscale, linked to irreversibility of the reduced dynamics, directly leads to a\ndynamical semigroup expressed in terms of quantities typical of scattering\ntheory. Its generator consists of two terms, the first linked to a coherent\nwavelike behaviour, the second related to an interaction having a measuring\ncharacter, possibly connected to events the microsystem produces propagating\ninside matter. In case these events breed a measurement, an explicit\nrealization of some concepts of modern quantum mechanics (\"effects\" and\n\"operations\") arises. The relevance of this description to a recent debate\nquestioning the validity of ordinary quantum mechanics to account for such\nexperimental situations as, e.g., neutron-interferometry, is briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 1997 17:18:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
