The\nalgorithm is implemented in Mathematica. The program condens.m automatically\ncarries out the lengthy symbolic computations for the construction of conserved\ndensities. The code is tested on several well-known partial differential\nequations from soliton theory. For systems with parameters, condens.m can be\nused to determine the conditions on these parameters so that a sequence of\nconserved densities might exist. The existence of a large number of\nconservation laws is a predictor for integrability of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 1997 19:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
