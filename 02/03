After a brief discussion of this progress, attention is\nfocussed on two particular, related aspects. Firstly, the possible definitions\nof diffeomorphisms or gauge transformations in Regge calculus are examined and\nexamples are given. Secondly, an investigation of the signature of the\nsimplicial supermetric is described. This is the Lund-Regge metric on\nsimplicial configuration space and defines the distance between simplicial\nthree-geometries. Information on its signature can be used to extend the rather\nlimited results on the signature of the supermetric in the continuum case. This\ninformation is obtained by a combination of analytic and numerical techniques.\nFor the three-sphere and the three-torus, the numerical results agree with the\nanalytic ones and show the existence of degeneracy and signature change. Some\n``vertical'' directions in simplicial configuration space, corresponding to\nsimplicial metrics related by gauge transformations, are found for the\nthree-torus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 1997 12:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

It is valid in the\nwide range of intensities and frequencies of the field, from the perturbation\ntheory to the tunneling regime, and is applicable to the excess-photon as well\nas near-threshold detachment. Practically, the formulae are valid when the\nnumber of photons is greater than two. They produce the total detachment rates,\nrelative intensities of the excess-photon peaks, and photoelectron angular\ndistributions for the hydrogen and halogen negative ions, in agreement with\nthose obtained in other, more numerically involved calculations in both\nperturbative and non-perturbative regimes. Our approach explains the extreme\nsensitivity of the multiphoton detachment probability to the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the bound-state wave function. Rapid oscillations in the angular\ndependence of the $n$-photon detachment probability are shown to arise due to\ninterference of the two classical trajectories which lead to the same final\nstate after the electron emerges at the opposite sides of the atom when the\nfield is close to maximal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 1997 01:21:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
