Lett. {\\bf 75}, 2360 (1996)] we briefly\ndiscussed the existence and nature of ferroelectric order in positionally\ndisordered dipolar materials. Here we report further results and give a\ncomplete description of our work. Simulations of randomly frozen and\ndynamically disordered dipolar soft spheres are used to study ferroelectric\nordering in non-crystalline systems. We also give a physical interpretation of\nthe simulation results in terms of short- and long-range interactions. Cases\nwhere the dipole moment has 1, 2, and 3 components (Ising, XY and XYZ models,\nrespectively) are considered. It is found that the Ising model displays\nferroelectric phases in frozen amorphous systems, while the XY and XYZ models\nform dipolar glass phases at low temperatures. In the dynamically disordered\nmodel the equations of motion are decoupled such that particle translation is\ncompletely independent of the dipolar forces. These systems spontaneously\ndevelop long-range ferroelectric order at nonzero temperature despite the\nabsence of any fined-tuned short-range spatial correlations favoring dipolar\norder. Furthermore, since this is a nonequilibrium model we find that the\nparaelectric to ferroelectric transition depends on the particle mass. For the\nXY and XYZ models, the critical temperatures extrapolate to zero as the mass of\nthe particle becomes infinite, whereas, for the Ising model the critical\ntemperature is almost independent of mass and coincides with the ferroelectric\ntransition found for the randomly frozen system at the same density. Thus in\nthe infinite mass limit the results of the frozen amorphous systems are\nrecovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 1997 22:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
