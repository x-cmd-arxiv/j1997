One might hope that\nelimination of the first problem might ameliorate the second as well. We\nanalyze and generalize a metric, originally proposed by Krasnikov for two\nspacetime dimensions, which does not suffer from the first difficulty. As a\nconsequence, the Krasnikov metric has the interesting property that although\nthe time for a one-way trip to a distant star cannot be shortened, the time for\na round trip, as measured by clocks on Earth, can be made arbitrarily short. In\nour four dimensional extension of this metric, a ``tube'' is constructed along\nthe path of an outbound spaceship, which connects the Earth and the star.\nInside the tube spacetime is flat, but the light cones are opened out so as to\nallow superluminal travel in one direction.
