Since the dynamical friction time is roughly (1\nGyr), a steady-state should have been reached by redshift z < 5. Star-forming\nregions within galaxies clearly present no dynamical problems.

Causality constraints have for long been known to\nrequire the presence of an under-density in the surrounding matter compensating\nthe defect network on large scales. This so-called compensation can never be\nneglected and significantly complicates calculations in defect scenarios, eg.\ncomputing cosmic microwave background fluctuations. A quick and dirty way to\nimplement the compensation are the so-called compensation fudge factors. Here\nwe derive the complete photon-baryon-CDM backreaction effects in defect\nscenarios. The fudge factor comes out as an algebraic identity and so we drop\nthe negative qualifier ``fudge''. The compensation scale is computed and\nphysically interpreted. Secondary backreaction effects exist, and neglecting\nthem constitutes the well-defined approximation scheme within which one should\nconsider compensation factor calculations. We quantitatively assess the\naccuracy of this approximation, and conclude that the considerable pains\nassociated with improving on it are often a waste of effort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 1997 15:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The chiral anomaly in a four-dimensional spacetime with torsion\nis also shown to contain a contribution proportional to $N$, besides the usual\nPontryagin density related to the spacetime curvature. The violation of chiral\nsymmetry can thus depend on the instanton number of the tangent frame bundle of\nthe manifold. Similar invariants can be constructed in D>4 dimensions and the\nexistence of the corresponding nontrivial excitations is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 1997 18:44:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}
