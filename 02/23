Alert 95-30\nwas observed in real-time by the Global Microlensing Alert Network (GMAN),\nwhich obtained densely sampled photometric and spectroscopic data throughout\nthe event. We interpret the light-curve ``fine structure'' as indicating\ntransit of the lens across the extended face of the source star. This signifies\nresolution of a star several kpc distant. We find a lens angular impact\nparameter theta_{min}/theta_{source} = 0.715 +/- 0.003. This information, along\nwith the radius and distance of the source, provides an additional constraint\non the lensing system. Spectroscopic and photometric data indicate the source\nis an M4 III star of radius 61 +/- 12 Rsun, located on the far side of the\nbulge at 9 kpc. We derive a lens angular velocity, relative to the source, of\n21.5 +/- 4.9 km/s/kpc, where the error is dominated by uncertainty in the\nsource radius. Likelihood analysis yields a median lens mass of\n0.67{+2.53}{-0.46} Msun, located with 80% probability in the Galactic bulge at\na distance of 6.93{+1.56}{-2.25} kpc. If the lens is a main-sequence star, we\ncan include constraints on the lens luminosity. This modifies our estimates to\nM_lens = 0.53{+0.52}{-0.35} Msun and D_lens = 6.57{+0.99}{-2.25} kpc. Spectra\ntaken during the event show that the absorption line equivalent widths of H\nalpha and the TiO bands near 6700 A vary, as predicted for microlensing of an\nextended source. This is most likely due to center-to-limb variation in the\nstellar spectral lines. These data demonstrate the feasibility of using\nmicrolensing limb crossings as a tool to probe stellar atmospheres directly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 1997 21:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
