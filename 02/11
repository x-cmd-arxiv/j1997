This leads, even in the lowest-possible energy\nstate, to vibrations, and thus, to the so-called zero-point energy. For\nchemically bound hydrogen the zero-point energy can be quite substantial. For\nexample, for a free H_2 molecule it is 0.26 eV, a significant value in the\nrealm of chemistry, where often an energy of the order of 0.1 eV/atom (or 2.3\nkcal/mol) decides whether or not a chemical reaction takes place with an\nappreciable rate. Yet, in many theoretical studies the dynamics of chemical\nreactions involving hydrogen has been treated classically or quasi-classically,\nassuming that the quantum mechanical nature of H nuclei, i.e. the zero-point\neffects, will not strongly affect the relevant physical or chemical properties.\nIn this paper we show that this assumption is not justified. We will\ndemonstrate that for very basic and fundamental catalytic-reaction steps,\nnamely the dissociative adsorption of molecular hydrogen at transition metal\nsurfaces and its time-reverse process, the associative desorption, zero-point\neffects can not only quantitatively but even qualitatively affect the chemical\nprocesses and rates. Our calculations (treating electrons as well as H nuclei\nquantum-mechanically) establish the importance of additional zero-point effects\ngenerated by the H_2-surface interaction and how energy of the H-H stretch\nvibration is transferred into those and vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 1997 09:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
