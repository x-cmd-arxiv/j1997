These\npost-AGB (PAGB) stars are the brightest members of Population II systems. They\nshould have a narrow luminosity function, bounded from above by the shorter\ntransition times of more massive and more luminous remnants, and from below by\nthe core mass corresponding to the lowest-mass stars that are leaving the main\nsequence. Moreover, PAGB A-F supergiants are easily recognized because of their\nenormous Balmer jumps, and should lie both in ellipticals and the halos of\nspirals. I describe a photometric system that combines Gunn u with the standard\nBVI bandpasses, and report a successful search for PAGB stars in the halo of\nM31 using this uBVI system. The zero-point calibration will come from PAGB A\nand F stars in Galactic globular clusters. Four are presently known, and have a\nmean Mv = -3.4 with a scatter of only 0.2 mag. With this Mv we exactly\nreproduce the accepted M31 distance from its halo PAGB stars. Future plans\ninclude a uBVI survey of Milky Way globular clusters and Local Group galaxies\nin order to strengthen the zero-point calibration. Ultimately we can reach the\nVirgo Cluster through a distance ladder with only three rungs: subdwarf\nparallaxes, Milky Way globular clusters, and then directly to Virgo (with HST).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 1997 21:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
