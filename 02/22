The method consists in writing the variationally determined\ndensity operator as the most general Gaussian functional of the quantized field\noperators. There are mainly two advantages in working with one-dimension.\nFirst, the existence of an exact solution for the ground-state and excitation\nenergies. Second, neither in the perturbative results nor in the Gaussian\napproximation itself we do not have to deal with the three-dimensional\npatologies of the contact interaction . So that this scheme provides a clear\ncomparison between these three different results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 1997 21:45:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 1999 21:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
