The data center principally around the existence of power-law\nfunctional forms in the distribution of the sizes of extinction events and\nother quantities. We then propose a new mathematical model of mass extinction\nwhich does not rely on coevolutionary effects and in which extinction is caused\nentirely by the action of environmental stresses on species. In combination\nwith a simple model of species adaptation we show that this process can account\nfor all the observed data without the need to invoke coevolution and critical\nprocesses. The model also makes some independent predictions, such as the\nexistence of ``aftershock'' extinctions in the aftermath of large mass\nextinction events, which should in theory be testable against the fossil\nrecord.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 1997 17:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

In addition to the usual N-1\nfundamental monopoles, the N-th BPS monopole appears from the Kaluza-Klein\nsector. When all N monopoles are present, net magnetic charge vanishes and the\nsolution can be reinterpreted as a Wilson-loop instanton of unit Pontryagin\nnumber. The instanton/multi-monopole moduli space is explicitly constructed,\nand seen to be identical to a Coulomb phase moduli space of a U(1)^N gauge\ntheory in 2+1 dimensions related to Kronheimer's gauge theory of SU(N) type.\nThis extends the results by Intriligator and Seiberg to the finite couplings\nthat, in the infrared limit of Kronheimer's theory, the Coulomb phase\nparameterizes a centered SU(N) instanton.
