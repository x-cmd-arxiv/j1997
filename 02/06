In this way one obtains immediately the\ndescription in terms of unconstrained gauge invariant variables which was\npreviously obtained by explicitly resolving Gauss' law in a modified axial\ngauge. In this gauge, which is a variant of 't Hooft's Abelian gauges, magnetic\nmonopoles occur. It is shown how the Pontryagin index of the gauge field is\nrelated to the magnetic charges. It turns out that the magnetic monopoles are\nsufficient to account for the non-trivial topological structure of the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 1997 12:21:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 1997 16:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
