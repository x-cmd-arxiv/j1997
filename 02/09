The difference between the slope of the Mg2-sigma relation and the\nslope of the <Fe>-sigma relation indicates that the abundance ratio [Mg/Fe]\nincreases with the velocity dispersion. The <Fe> index is stronger correlated\nwith the projected cluster surface density, than with the galaxy mass or the\nvelocity dispersion. Also the Mg2 index depends on the cluster environment. The\ndependence on the environment implies that [Mg/Fe] decreases with increasing\ndensity. The M/L ratios are strongly correlated with the Mg2 and Hbeta, while\n<Fe> is only weakly correlated with the M/L ratio.\n  Based on current stellar population models it is not yet possible to derive\nunique physical parameters (mean age, mean abundances, mean IMF, and fraction\nof dark matter) from the observables (line indices, velocity dispersion, mass,\nM/L ratio).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 1997 23:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

At very high temperatures the system does not exhibit any\nordering and in an intermediate regime clusters of relatively strongly coupled\nspins become ordered, whereas different clusters remain uncorrelated. This\nintermediate phase is identified by a jump in the order parameters. The\nspin-spin correlation function is used to partition the spins and the\ncorresponding data points into clusters.

Special emphasis is given to field\ntheory in anti-de Sitter space, as it represents a maximally symmetric\nspace-time of constant curvature which could arise in the local description of\nmatter interactions in small regions of space-time. Transform space rules for\nevaluating Feynman diagrams in Euclidean anti-de Sitter space are initially\ndefined using eigenfunctions based on generalized plane waves. It is shown\nthat, for a general curved space, the rules associated with the vertex are\ndependent on the type of interaction being considered. A condition for\neliminating this dependence is given. It is demonstrated that the vacuum and\npropagator in conformally flat coordinates in anti-de Sitter space are\nequivalent to those analytically continued from $H^4$ and that transform space\nrules based on these coordinates can be used more readily. A proof of the\nanalogue of Goldstone's theorem in anti-de Sitter space is given, using a\ngeneralized plane wave representation of the commutator of the current and the\nscalar field. It is shown that the introduction of curvature in the space-time\nshifts the momentum by an amount which is determined by the Riemann tensor to\nfirst order, and it follows that there is a shift in both the momentum and mass\nscale in anti-de Sitter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 1997 02:29:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 1997 10:47:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 1997 03:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
