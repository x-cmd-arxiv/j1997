We explore the origin of these distinct GC\npopulations, the implications for galaxy formation and evolution, and identify\nseveral new properties of GC systems. First, when we separate the metal-rich\nand metal-poor subpopulations, in galaxies with bimodal GC metallicity\ndistributions, we find that the mean metallicity of the metal-rich GCs\ncorrelates well with parent galaxy luminosity but the mean metallicity of the\nmetal-poor ones does not. This indicates that the metal-rich GCs are closely\ncoupled to the galaxy and share a common chemical enrichment history with the\ngalaxy field stars. The mean metallicity of the metal-poor population is\nlargely independent of the galaxy luminosity. Second, the slope of the GC\nsystem radial surface density varies considerably in early-type galaxies.\nHowever the galaxies with relatively populous GC systems for their luminosity\n(called high specific frequency, S_N) only have shallow, extended radial\ndistributions. A characteristic of high S_N galaxies is that their GCs are\npreferentially located in the outer galaxy regions relative to the underlying\nstarlight. Third, we find that the ratio of metal-rich to metal-poor GCs\ncorrelates with S_N. In other words, high S_N galaxies have proportionately\nmore metal-poor GCs, per unit galaxy light, than low S_N galaxies. Fourth, we\nfind steeper metallicity gradients in high S_N galaxies. This is due to the\ngreater number of metal-poor GCs at large galactocentric radii. We critically\nreview current ideas for the origin of GCs in giant elliptical (gE) and cD\ngalaxies and conclude that the gaseous merger model of Ashman & Zepf (1992) is\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 1997 19:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

M32 is also rapidly rotating; 85-90% of the\nstars have the same sense of rotation around the symmetry axis. Previous work\nhas shown that flattened, rapidly rotating two-integral models can be\nbar-unstable. We have performed N-body simulations to test whether this is the\ncase for M32.

The time evolution\nof the models was calculated with a `self-consistent field' code on a Cray T3D\nparallel supercomputer. We find both models to be dynamically stable. This\nimplies that they provide a physically meaningful description of M32, and that\nthe inclination of M32 (and hence its intrinsic flattening) cannot be strongly\nconstrained through stability arguments.\n  Previous work on the stability of f(E,L_z) models has shown that the bar-mode\nis the only possibly unstable mode for systems rounder than q=0.3, and that the\nlikelihood for this mode to be unstable increases with flattening and rotation\nrate. The f(E,L_z) models studied for M32 are stable, and M32 has a higher\nrotation rate than nearly all other elliptical galaxies.

In this new\nmethod, the first class Hamiltonian, which also needs infinite correction terms\nis obtained simply by replacing the original variables in the original\nHamiltonian with the BFT physical variables. Remarkably all the infinite\ncorrection terms can be expressed in the compact exponential form. We also show\nthat in our model the Poisson brackets of the BFT physical variables in the\nextended phase space are the same structure as the Dirac brackets of the\noriginal phase space variables. With the help of both our newly developed\nLagrangian formulation and Hamilton's equations of motion, we obtain the\ndesired classical Lagrangian corresponding to the first class Hamiltonian which\ncan be reduced to the generalized St\\\"uckelberg Lagrangian which is non-trivial\nconjecture in our infinitely many terms involved in Hamiltonian and Lagrangian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 1997 23:33:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 1997 06:36:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 1998 02:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
