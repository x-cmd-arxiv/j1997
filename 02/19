Averaged over all of our data, the\nrest-frame velocity dispersion sigma_v of the central lens galaxy G1 is sigma_v\n= 279 +- 12 km/s. However, there appears to be a significant decrease in\nsigma_v as a function of distance from the center of G1 that is not typical of\nbrightest cluster galaxies. Within 0.2\" of the center of G1, we find the\naverage sigma_v = 316+- 14 km/s, whereas for positions > 0.2\" from the center\nof G1, we find the average sigma_v= 266+-12 km/s. A plausible explanation is\nthat G1 contains a central massive dark object of mass M_MDO ~ 4x10^9\nh_100^{-1} M_sun (h_100 = H_0/100km/s/Mpc), which contributes to the central\nvelocity dispersion, and that the outer value of sigma_v is the appropriate\nmeasure of the depth of the potential well of G1. The determination of a\nluminosity-weighted estimate of sigma_v is essential for a determination of H_0\nfrom 0957+561; our accurate measurements remove one of the chief uncertainties\nin the assumed form of the mass distribution of the lens. Thus, with the recent\napparent reduction in the uncertainty in the measurement of the time delay for\nthe images A and B of 0957+561, Delta tau_BA = 417+-3 d (Kundic et al. 1996),\nwe obtain an estimate for the Hubble constant: H_0 = 62+-7 km/s/Mpc. If for\nsome reason the trend of sigma_v with slit position is spurious and we should\nuse the dispersion averaged along the slit, then the estimate of H_0 increases\nto 67+-8 km/s/Mpc. These standard errors do not, however, include any\ncontribution from any errors in the assumed form of the mass distribution of\nthe lens.

The story of their discovery and the characterization of their\nproperties is told here. Their recovery from the noise of the night sky\nbackground is a strong testament to the severity of surface brightness\nselection effects. LSB galaxies have a number of remarkable properties which\ndistinguish them from the more familiar Hubble Sequence of spirals. The two\nmost important are 1) they evolve at a significantly slower rate and may well\nexperience star formation outside of the molecular cloud environment, 2) they\nare embedded in dark matter halos which are of lower density and more extended\nthan the halos around high surface brightness (HSB) disk galaxies. Compared to\nHSB disks, LSB disks are strongly dark matter dominated at all radii and show a\nsystematic increase in M/L with central surface brightness.\n  In addition, the recognition that large numbers of LSB galaxies actually\nexist has changed the form of the galaxy luminosity function and has clearly\nincreased the space density of galaxies at z = 0. Recent CCD surveys have\nuncovered a population of red LSB disks that may be related to the excess of\nfaint blue galaxies detected at moderate redshifts. LSB galaxies offer us a new\nwindow into galaxy evolution and formation which is every bit as important as\nthose processes which have produced easy to detect galaxies. Indeed, the\napparent youth of some LSB galaxies suggest that galaxy formation is a greatly\nextended process. While the discovery of LSB galaxies have lead to new\ninsights, it remains unwise to presume that we now have a representative sample\nwhich encompasses all galaxy types and forms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 1997 17:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

The key\nobservation is the existence of a soft mechanism of heavy flavour production,\nwhich scales in the quark mass and dominates shadowing corrections and\ndiffraction. It naturally explains the surprisingly strong nuclear suppression\nof J/Psi at large Feynman-x_F. The low-x_F region is subject to a complicated\ninterplay of hard and soft mechanisms. With evaluated parameters we nicely\ndescribe available data on charmonium production in proton-nucleus collisions.\nUsing these results we predict a new process, diffractive production of\ncharmonium on a nucleon target, which fraction in the total production rate of\ncharmonium is evaluated at 12%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 1997 21:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 1997 22:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

In the present\narticle we propose a more detailed proof of this fact then the one given by\nVaragnolo and Vasserot. The proof is based on certain non-trivial properties of\nCherednik's commuting difference operators. The quantum toroidal action on the\nFock space depends on a certain parameter. We find that with a specific choice\nof this parameter the action on the Fock spaces gives rise to the toroidal\naction on irreducible level-1 highest weight modules of the affine quantum\nalgebra $U_q(\\hat{sl}_n)$. Similarly, by a specific choice of the parameter,\nthe level (1,0) vertex representation of the quantum toroidal algebra gives\nrise to a $U_q(sl_n,tor)$-module structure on irreducible level-1 highest\nweight $U_q(\\hat{sl}_n)$-modules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 1997 13:28:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Mar 1997 06:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
