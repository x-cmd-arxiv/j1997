Still, they\nhave been generally ignored in quantitative analysis of it, essentially due to\nthe lack of an objective tool to identify and quantify the voids. To overcome\nthis, we present the Void-Finder algorithm, a novel tool for objectively\nquantifying galaxy voids. The algorithm classifies galaxies as either wall- or\nfield-galaxies. Then it identifies voids in the wall-galaxy distribution. Voids\nare defined as continuous volumes that do not contain any wall-galaxies. The\nvoids must be thicker than an adjustable limit, which is refined in successive\niterations. We test the algorithm using Voronoi tessellations. By appropriate\nscaling of the parameters we apply it to the SSRS2 survey and to the IRAS 1.2\nJy. Both surveys show similar properties: ~50% of the volume is filled by the\nvoids, which have a scale of at least 40 Mpc, and a -0.9 under-density. Faint\ngalaxies populate the voids more than bright ones. These results suggest that\nboth optically and IRAS selected galaxies delineate the same LSS. Comparison\nwith the recovered mass distribution further suggests that the observed voids\nin the galaxy distribution correspond well to under-dense regions in the mass\ndistribution. This confirms the gravitational origin of the voids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 1997 13:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
