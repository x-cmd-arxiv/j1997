Following Schwarzschild's modeling\napproach, a representative library of orbits is calculated in a given\npotential; then the non-negative superposition of these orbits is determined to\nfit best a given set of observational constraints. Our implementation\nincorporates several new features: (i) we calculate velocity profiles and\nrepresent them by a Gauss-Hermite series. This allows us to constrain the\norbital anisotropy in the fit. (ii) we take into account the error on each\nobservational constraint to obtain an objective chi2 measure for the\nquality-of-fit. Only projected, observable quantities are included in the fit,\nand aperture binning and seeing convolution of the data are properly taken into\naccount. This scheme is valid for any geometry, but here we focus on spherical\ngeometry and the issue of dark halos around elliptical galaxies. We model\nradially extended velocity profiles of the E0 galaxy NGC 2434, and find that\nconstant M/L models are clearly ruled out, regardless of the orbital\nanisotropy. To study how much dark matter is needed, we considered a sequence\nof cosmologically motivated `star+halo' potentials, which are specified by the\nstellar mass-to-light ratio Gamma and the characteristic halo velocity, V_200\n(from Navarro et al. 1996). The star+halo models provide an excellent fit to\nthe data, with Gamma=3.35+-0.25 (in B-band solar units) and V_200=450+-100km/s.\nThe best-fitting potential has a circular velocity Vc that is constant (at\n~300km/s) to within 10% between 0.2--3 effective radii. In NGC 2434 roughly\nhalf of the mass within an effective radius appears to be dark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 1997 21:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The strength of the weak coupling\nof the rho(770) meson is uniquely determined by vector-meson dominance in\nelectromagnetic interactions; flavor and chiral symmetry breaking effects\nmodify the coupling of other vector mesons and axial-vector mesons. Many decay\nrates are calculated and compared to experimental data and partly to\npredictions of other models. A parameter-free description of the decay K^+ -->\npi^+ e^+e^- is obtained. Predictions for several not yet observed decay rates\nand reaction cross sections are presented. The relation between the conserved\nvector current hypothesis and meson dominance is clarified. Phenomenological\nsuccess of the meson dominance suggests that in some calculations based on the\nstandard model the weak quark-antiquark annihilation and creation diagrams may\nbe more important than anticipated so far. The processes are identified where\nthe meson dominance fails, implying that they are governed, on the quark level,\nby some other standard model diagrams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Feb 1997 09:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
