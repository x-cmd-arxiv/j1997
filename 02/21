In this model, bursters are born in the galactic\ndisk with large recoil velocities V_r, and GRBs are beamed to within emission\ncones of half-angle \\phi centered on V_r. We describe scenarios for\nmagnetically -channeled GRBs that have such beaming characteristics. We then\nmake detailed comparisons of this halo beaming model (HBM) to BATSE and PVO\ndata for GRB intensity & angular position distributions. Acceptable fits to\nobservations of over 1000 bursts are obtained for \\phi = 15 - 30 degrees and\nfor a BATSE sampling depth ~ 180 kpc. Present data favor a truly isotropic\n(cosmological) model over the HBM, but not by a statistically compelling\nmargin. Bursters born in nearby external galaxies, such as M31, are almost\nentirely undetectable in the HBM because of misdirected beaming. We analyze\nseveral refinements of the basic HBM: gamma-ray intensities that vary with\nangle from the beam axis; non-standard-candle GRB luminosity functions; and\nmodels including a subset of bursters that do not escape from the galaxy. We\nalso discuss the energy budgets for the bursters, the origins of their recoils,\nand the physics of burst beaming and alignment.

The Mermin-Wagner theorem in two dimensions is automatically\nsatisfied. The effect of collective modes on single-particle properties is then\nobtained by a paramagnon-like formula that is consistent with the two-particle\nproperties in the sense that the potential energy obtained from $Tr\\Sigma G$ is\nidentical to that obtained using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for\nsusceptibilities. The vertex corrections are included through constant\nirreducible vertices. The theory is in quantitative agreement with Monte Carlo\nsimulations for both single-particle and two-particle properties.

In contrast to experiments in circular\ngeometries, we found ISR states below a particular value of the control\nparameter and SDC states above this value. By characterizing the pattern with a\nglobal measure, the pattern entropy, we found that the transition from SDC to\nISR showed similarities to phase transitions in equilibrium finite-size\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 1997 23:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
