Motivated by the GS cascade, we calculate the linear\ncollisionless dissipation of Alfven waves with frequencies much less than the\nproton cyclotron frequency, but with perpendicular wavelengths of order the\nLarmor radius of thermal protons. In plasmas appropriate to hot accretion flows\n(proton temperature much greater than electron temperature) the dissipated\nAlfven wave energy primarily heats the protons.
