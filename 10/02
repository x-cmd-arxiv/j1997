The flow in models without SNIa heating is considerably\nordered, and essentially all the gas lost by the stars is cooled and\naccumulated in the galaxy center. If rotation is present, the cold material\nsettles in a disk on the galactic equatorial plane. Models with a time\ndecreasing SNIa heating host gas flows that can be much more complex.

In this phase of strong decoupling, cold filaments are\ncreated at the interface between inflowing and outflowing gas. Models with more\nrealistic values of the dynamical quantities are preferentially found in the\nwind phase with respect to their spherical counterparts of equal Lb.

However, unlike perfect point sources, the fraction of a\ngalaxy's light contained within the limiting isophote is a function of\nredshift, due to the combined effects of the point spread function and\ncosmological dimming. This redshift variation in the measured isophotal\nluminosity can strongly affect the derived luminosity function. Using\nsimulations which include the effects of seeing upon both disk and elliptical\ngalaxies, we explore the size of the systematic biases which can result from\nignoring the redshift variation in the fraction of detected light. We show that\nthe biases lead to underestimates in the normalization of the luminosity\nfunction, as well as changes in shape. The size of the bias depends upon\nredshift, and thus can mimic galaxy evolution. Surprisingly, these biases can\nbe extremely large without affecting <V/V_max>. However, these biases can be\ndetected in the full distribution of V/V_max, and in fact may have already been\ndetected in recent surveys. Because the systematic biases result from the\nredshift variation in the fraction of lost light, the biases are not\nsignificant when the fraction of lost light is always small over the entire\nsurvey volume, for all galaxy types; however, modern surveys usually violate\nthese conditions. We show that the expected biases are not necessarily\neliminated when using aperture magnitudes, FOCAS \"total\" magnitudes, or Kron\nmagnitudes, but may be reduced if Petrosian magnitudes are used.

Unlike high-redshift\nDLA systems (z>2), the z=0.558 absorber seems to originate in a galaxy that has\nalready attained the abundances and dust content of present-day disk galaxies.\nThe analysis of our imaging data lends support to the presence of an\nintervening galaxy. After careful subtraction of the BL Lac image, an object at\n1.6 arcsec from PKS 0118-272 is detected. At the absorber redshift the\nprojected distance (14 h_50^-1 kpc) and the absolute magnitude (M_R ~ -22.3) of\nthis companion are consistent with those found for galaxies associated with\nlow-redshift DLA systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 1997 12:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Relations between the\nobserved abundances measured in the gas phase and the overall abundances (gas\nplus dust) are derived as a function of dust-to-gas ratio, metallicity,\nelement-to-element abundance pattern, average extinction coefficient of dust\ngrains, and chemical composition of dust grains. A method is presented for\ndetermining dust-to-gas ratios, dust-to-metals ratios, and dust-corrected\nrelative abundances in DLA absorbers by assuming dust of Galactic type and\nconstant abundance ratios between iron-peak elements. The method is applied to\na sample of 17 DLA absorbers with available Zn, Cr and/or Fe measurements. The\nresulting dust-to-gas ratios are mostly distributed between 2% and 25% of the\nGalactic value, in good quantitative agreement with the results from reddening\nstudies of QSOs with foreground DLA absorption. A correlation is found between\ndust-to-gas ratio and metallicity in DLA galaxies, with a typical\ndust-to-metals ratio of ~ 60% the Galactic value. The derived dust-to-metals\nratios are then used to correct from the effects of dust the abundance ratios\n[Si/Fe], [S/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Mn/Fe], [Ni/Fe] available for a sub-sample of 9\nabsorbers.
