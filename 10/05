The Jean's\ncriteria and the cooling criteria are those which are currently used. However\nin such a simple scheme, a fundamental problem occurs in hierarchical pictures,\nnamely the OVERCOOLING: the predicted fraction of primordial gas expected to\nhave cooled in the history of structure formation is for too large. The\nsolution to this problem is likely to be a substantial re-heating phase. Here,\nwe discussed one possible solution: the warm IGM picture. If the feedback of\ngalaxy formation is able to heat the IGM up to temperatures of the order of\n$10^5-10^6$ K, galaxy formation is inhibited on small mass scale. This leads to\nan inverse hierarchical picture: most of the large galaxies form at redshifts\nin the range 3 to 5, while small galaxies form at two different epoch: at an\nearly phase at redshift greater than five and at a late phase, between redshift\n3 and 0. Such a scheme may reproduce quite well the amount of HI gas versus\nredshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Oct 1997 17:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
