Initial (or `geminate') recombination is a process where a\ndissociated structure (anion, vortex, kink etc.) recombines with its twin\nbrother (cation, anti-vortex, anti-kink) generated in the same nucleation\nevent. Initial recombination is important if there is an asymptotically\nvanishing interaction force instead of a generic saddle-type activation\nbarrier. At low temperatures, initial recombination strongly dominates\nhomogeneous recombination. In a first part, we discuss the effect in one-,\ntwo-, and three-dimensional diffusion controlled systems with spherical\nsymmetry. Since there is no well-defined saddle, we introduce a threshold which\nis to some extent arbitrary but which is restricted by physically reasonable\nconditions. We show that the dependence of the nucleation rate on the specific\nchoice of this threshold is strongest for one-dimensional systems and decreases\nin higher dimensions. We discuss also the influence of a weak driving force and\nshow that the transport current is directly determined by the imbalance of the\nactivation rate in the direction of the field and the rate against this\ndirection. In a second part, we apply the results to the overdamped sine-Gordon\nsystem at equilibrium. It turns out that diffusive initial recombination is the\nessential mechanism which governs the equilibrium kink nucleation rate.

Perturbative calculations for such processes are known to be\ninherently ambiguous due to the arbitrariness of direction of the monopole\nstring; this requires use of some prescription to obtain physical results. We\nargue that different prescriptions lead to drastically different physical\nresults which suggests that at present we do not have an entirely satisfactory\nprocedure for the elimination of string arbitrariness (this problem is quite\nseparate from the problems caused by the large coupling constant). We then\nanalyze the consequencies of discrete symmetries (P and C) for the monopole\nproduction processes and for the monopole-antimonopole states. The P and C\nselection rules for the monopole-antimonopole states turn out to be different\nfrom those for the ordinary fermion-antifermion or boson-antiboson system. In\nparticular, the spin 1/2 monopole and antimonopole should have the same\nhelicities if they are produced through the one-photon annihilation of an\nelectron and positron. A stronger selection rule holds for spinless monopoles:\nCP symmetry absolutely forbids the monopole-antimonopole production through the\none-photon annihilation of an electron and positron. Single-photon $e^+e^- \\to\ng^+g^-$ amplitude has been a key input in calculating the contribution of\nvirtual $g^+g^-$ pairs to various physical processes such as the decay $Z\\to\n3\\gamma$ and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.
