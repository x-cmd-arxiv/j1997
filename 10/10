The hybrid model\nleads to a more moderate luminosity of 5.2 10^{42} erg/s, of which 1.0 10^{42}\nerg/s can be attributed to shocked superwind gas. We link the remaining 4.2\n10^{42} erg/s powerlaw to an AGN component because the alternative of\ninverse-compton scattering of the FIR radiation leads to a too low flux when\nestimated with available data.

They\nsuggest that it may belong to a low surface-brightness dwarf galaxy, or to the\ntidal debris of a disrupted galaxy, and derive an optical depth for\ngravitational lensing through the intervening system which is consistent with\nthe observed value. Such interpretation of the microlensing events toward the\nLMC has major implications for the nature of the dark matter, and thus should\nbe tested in every conceivable way.\n  We suggest a method utilizing the microlensing data themselves to\ndiscriminate between the various hypotheses. We find that the first eight MACHO\nevents toward the LMC are as consistent with a standard halo distribution of\n0.5 solar-mass MACHOs (best fit), as they are with an intervening population\nhaving a transverse speed of ~240 km/s and a Miller-Scalo stellar IMF.

The\nmorphology of the dust features are strikingly similar to that observed for the\noptical nebulosity AND the X-ray emission. A physical connection between the\ndifferent phases of the interstellar medium therefore seems likely.\n  We discuss three different options for the origin of the dusty nebular\nfilaments: Condensation out of a cooling flow, mass loss of late-type stars\nwithin NGC 5846, and material donated by a small neighbouring galaxy. We\nconclude that the dust as well as the optical nebulosity are most likely\nproducts of a recent interaction with a small, relatively gas-rich galaxy,\nprobably of Magellanic type.\n  Dust grains in the dust lane are destroyed by sputtering in the hot,\nX-ray-emitting gas in less than about 10^7 yr, which is shorter than the\ncrossing time of a (small) galaxy through the central 5 kpc of NGC 5846. We\nargue that the dust is replenished by evaporation of cool, dense gas cloudlets\nthat were brought in during the interaction. The evaporation rate of cool gas\nin NGC 5846, 0.001 solar mass per year, is consistent with the \"mass deposition\nrate\" derived from X-ray measurements.\n  The energy lost by the hot gas through heating of dust and evaporation of\ncool gas clouds in the central few kpc of NGC 5846 is adequately balanced by\nheat sources: transport of heat by electron conduction and loss of kinetic\nenergy of the in-falling galaxy.

It is shown, in the context of a simple model of\nthe Z(2) vortex core, how vortex condensation in Yang-Mills theory can account\nfor both Casimir scaling in intermediate size loops, and color-screening in\nlarger loops. An implication of our model is that the deviations from exact\nCasimir scaling, which tend to grow with loop size, become much more pronounced\nas the dimensionality of the group representation increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 1997 21:39:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 1997 13:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
