We propose a trilepton Higgs boson\nsearch based only upon the gauge interactions of the Higgs. This strategy can\nbe utilized successfully for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson as well as\nnon-standard Higgs bosons which break electroweak symmetry but have little to\ndo with fermion mass generation.
