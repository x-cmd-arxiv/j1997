If we accept the strict validity of the principle\nof relativity, such solutions describe objects of two essentially different\nnatures: carrying energy wave packets and inertia-free properly phase\nvibrations. Speeds of the first-type objects can exceed the plane wave velocity\n$c_*$ only inside media and are always less than the vacuum light speed $c$.\nParticularly, very fast sound pulses with speeds $c_* < v < c$ have already\nbeen launched. The second-type objects are incapable of carrying energy and\ninformation but have superluminal speed. If we admit the possibility of a\nbreakdown of Lorentz invariance, pulses described, for example, by superluminal\nsolutions of the Maxwell equations can be generated. Only experiment will give\nthe final answer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 1997 19:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The combination of density functional\nelectronic structure techniques and a dielectric continuum model for\nelectrostatic solvation applied to the Fe(H$_2$O)$_6$$^{3+}$ complex yields\n-1020~kcal/mol (experimental values -1037~kcal/mol to -1019~kcal/mol) for the\nabsolute free energy of the aqueous ferric ion. The predicted reaction energy\nchange for the first hydrolysis is 2 kcal/mol (compared to 3 kcal/mol\nexperimental). For the second hydrolysis, we found an unexpected low energy\nisomer of Fe(H$_2$O)$_4$(OH)$_2$$^{+}$ with five ligands in the inner sphere\nand one water outside. The cis and trans isomers are, respectively, slightly\nlower and higher in energy. Extrusion of the additional water to the outer\nsphere is nearly thermoneutral. The reaction free energy for the second\nhydrolysis is predicted in the range 16-18~kcal/mol, higher than the\nexperimental value of 5~kcal/mol. Since the theoretical predictions for the\nsecond hydrolysis are higher than experimental values and novel structures were\nencountered, we argue that conformational entropy is important in these\nreactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 1997 23:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}
