In these Lectures, we discuss various approaches to the description of\nhot and/or dense matter, including the simple Skyrme-type parameterization and\nrelativistic Walecka-type models, as well as microscopic Dirac-Brueckner and\nQCD sum rule approaches. As density and/or temperature of the hadronic system\nincreases, chiral symmetry is gradually restored, as indicated by the decrease\nof quark condensate. This has profound effects on the properties of hadrons,\nespecially their masses. We review various theoretical predictions for hadron\nproperties in dense matter. Experimentally, possible medium modifications of\nhadron properties can be studied through the measurements of particle spectra,\nflow, and particularly, electromagnetic observables. Particle production,\nespecially the production of rare particles such as kaons, vector mesons, and\nantiparticles, provides useful insight into heavy-ion collision dynamics, and\nhadron properties in dense matter. Collective flows of various kinds are\nimportant observables in heavy-ion collisions. They probe essentially the\nentire reaction process, and thus are very useful for the determination of the\nreaction dynamics. They also reflect the properties of hadrons in dense matter.\nElectromagnetic signals are considered penetrating probes that may carry\nundistorted information about the early stage of high-energy heavy-ion\ncollisions.

The deformation parameters for these quon algebras\nare roots of unity connected to an integer k. The case k=2 corresponds to\nfermions and the limiting case k going to infinity to bosons. Generalized\ncoherent states and supercoherent states are investigated. The Dirac quantum\nphase operator and the Fairlie-Fletcher-Zachos algebra are also considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 1997 13:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
