The present paper interprets the\nsame imaginary part in the framework of droplet nucleation theory in which the\nrate of transition from a metastable state to a stable one is proportional to\nthe imaginary part of the canonical partition function. The conclusions\nconcerning the emerging thermodynamics of black holes are essentially the same\nas before. The partition function for black holes with the above spectrum was\ncalculated exactly recently. It is the same as that of the primitive Ising\ndroplet model for nucleation in 1st-order phase transitions in 2 dimensions.\nThus one might learn about the quantum statistics of black holes by studying\nthat Ising model, the exact complex free energy of which is presented here for\nnegative magnetic fields, too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 1997 11:59:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 1997 11:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The idea of a vacuum is introduced as the\nunique algebraic projection on the base field embedded in the Clifford algebra,\nwhich is however equivalent to the term vacuum in axiomatic quantum field\ntheory and the GNS construction in C^*-algebras. This approach is shown to be\nequivalent to the usual picture which fixes one product but employs a variety\nof GNS states. The most striking novelty of the geometric approach is the fact\nthat dynamical data fix uniquely the vacuum and that positivity is not\nrequired. The usual concept of a statistical quantum state can be generalized\nto geometric meaningful but non-statistical, non-definite, situations.\nFurthermore, an algebraization of states takes place. An application to physics\nis provided by an U(2)-symmetry producing a gap-equation which governs a phase\ntransition. The parameterization of all vacua is explicitly calculated from\npropagator matrix elements. A discussion of the relation to BCS theory and\nBogoliubov-Valatin transformations is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 1997 09:06:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Feb 2001 19:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The condition of strong ellipticity of this boundary-value problem is\nformulated. The resolvent kernel and the heat kernel in the leading\napproximation are explicitly constructed. As a result, the previous work in the\nliterature on heat-kernel asymptotics is shown to be a particular case of a\nmore general structure. For a bosonic gauge theory on a compact Riemannian\nmanifold with smooth boundary, the problem is studied of obtaining a\ngauge-field operator of Laplace type, jointly with local and gauge-invariant\nboundary conditions, which should lead to a strongly elliptic boundary-value\nproblem. The scheme is extended to fermionic gauge theories by means of local\nand gauge-invariant projectors. After deriving a general condition for the\nvalidity of strong ellipticity for gauge theories, it is proved that for\nEuclidean Yang--Mills theory and Rarita--Schwinger fields all the above\nconditions can be satisfied. For Euclidean quantum gravity, however, this\nproperty no longer holds, i.e. the corresponding boundary-value problem is not\nstrongly elliptic. Some non-standard local formulae for the leading asymptotics\nof the heat-kernel diagonal are also obtained. It is shown that, due to the\nabsence of strong ellipticity, the heat-kernel diagonal is non-integrable near\nthe boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 1997 11:52:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 1998 23:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
