Using a natural degeneration of Grassmannians\n$G(k,n)$ to some Gorenstein toric Fano varieties $P(k,n)$ with conifolds\nsingularities which was recently described by Sturmfels, we suggest an explicit\nmirror construction for Calabi-Yau complete intersections $X \\subset G(k,n)$ of\narbitrary dimension.

Gopalswamy et al (1994) first reported\nthe detection of the TMBs and it was pointed out that the radio emission\nimplied a region of very high magnetic field so that the emission mechanism has\nto be gyroresonance or nonthermal gyrosynchrotron, but not free-free emission.\nIt was not possible to decide between gyroresonance and gyrosynchrotron\nprocesses because of the low time resolution (30 s) used in the data analysis.\nWe have since performed a detailed analysis of the Very Large Array data with\nfull time resolution (3.3 s) at two wavelengths (2 and 3.6 cm) and we can now\nadequately address the question of the emission mechanism of the TMBs. We find\nthat nonthermal processes indeed take place during the TMBs. We present\nevidence for nonthermal emission in the form of temporal and spatial structure\nof the TMBs. The fast time structure cannot be explained by a thermodynamic\ncooling time and therefore requires a nonthermal process. Using the physical\nparameters obtained from X-ray and radio observations, we determine the\nmagnetic field parameters of the loop and estimate the energy released during\nthe TMBs. The impulsive components of TMBs imply an energy release rate of 1.3\nx 10^22 erg/s so that the thermal energy content of the TMBs could be less than\n10^24 erg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 1997 04:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

This\ntransition takes place at a certain temperature $T_c(L)$ as the temperature is\ndecreased and, at a certain size $L_c (T)$ as the size of the system is\nincreased. The transition temperature $T_c (L)$ is suppressed as the sample\nsize is reduced, and vanishes for samples below a certain size. For\norder-disorder ferroelectrics, our theory shows that the suppression of $T_c$\nby a reduction in system size is not appreciable, a result that is borne out by\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 1997 06:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
