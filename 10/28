The electrically-charged Dirac fermions (holons),\ndescribing excitations about specific points on the fermi surface, e.g. those\ncorresponding to the nodes of a d-wave superconducting gap in high-$T_c$\ncuprates, condense, resulting in the opening of a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like gap\n(KT) at such nodes.

These are\nobtained by solution of an approximate set of field equations where only the\ndominant non-axisymmetric terms are taken into account. The progress with\nrespect to our former investigation consists in a higher relativistic order of\nthe non-axisymmetric terms included into the computation, namely the fully\nthree-dimensional treatment of the vector part of the space-time metric tensor\nas opposed to the scalar part, solely, in the former case. The scheme is\napplied to rotating stars built on a polytropic equation of state and compared\nto our previous results. The 3D-vector part turns out to inhibit the symmetry\nbreaking efficiently. Nevertheless, the bar mode instability is still possible\nfor an astrophysically relevant mass of M_ns=1.4 M_sun when a stiff polytropic\nequation of state with an adiabatic index of gamma=2.5 is employed.
