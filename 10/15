The combination of an efficient magnetic dynamo, likely operating\nduring the first seconds of the initially hot and turbulent MSP interior, and\nthe subsequent modest beaming of gamma-ray emitting outflows, would easily\naccount for energy constraints.

This analogy suggests that black\nhole mass $M$ might have a discrete spectrum. I review the physical arguments\nfor the expectation that black hole horizon area eigenvalues are uniformly\nspaced, or equivalently, that the spacing between stationary black hole mass\nlevels behaves like 1/M. This sort of spectrum has also emerged in a variety of\nformal approaches to black hole quantization by a number of workers (with some\nnotable exceptions). If true, this result indicates a distortion of the\nsemiclassical Hawking spectrum which could be observable even for macroscopic\nblack holes. Black hole entropy suggests that the mentioned mass levels should\nbe degenerate to the tune of an exponential in $M^2$, as first noted by\nMukhanov. This has implications for the statistics of the radiation.

Sources include binary systems in our Galaxy and massive black holes\nin distant galaxies. The radiation from many of these sources will be so strong\nthat it will be possible to make remarkably detailed studies of the physics of\nthe systems. These studies will have importance both for astrophysics (most\nnotably in binary evolution theory and models for active galaxies) and for\nfundamental physics. In particular, it should be possible to make decisive\nmeasurements to confirm the existence of black holes and to test, with\naccuracies better than 1%, general relativity's description of them. Other\nobservations can have fundamental implications for cosmology and for physical\ntheories of the unification of forces. In order to understand these\nconclusions, one must know how to estimate the gravitational radiation produced\nby different sources. In the first part of this lecture I review the dynamics\nof gravitational wave sources, and I derive simple formulas for estimating wave\namplitudes and the reaction effects on sources of producing this radiation.\nWith these formulas one can estimate, usually to much better than an order of\nmagnitude, the physics of most of the interesting low-frequency sources.

An\nillustration of the power of quantumized algorithms is the ability to\nefficiently solve the satisfiability problem, something that many believe is\nbeyond the capability of classical computers.
