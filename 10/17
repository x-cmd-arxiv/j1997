To distinguish among these possibilities, we\nhave searched for spatial variations in the 2.3 micron photometric CO index\nwithin the disks of three nearby galaxies (NGC 278, NGC 2649, & NGC 5713). This\nindex measures the strength of the absorption bands of molecular CO in stellar\natmospheres, and is strong in cool, low surface-gravity stars, reaching the\nlargest values for red supergiants. We observe significant spatial CO index\nvariations in two galaxies (NGC 278 & NGC 5713), indicating that the dominant\nstellar population in the near-infrared is not everywhere the same. Central CO\nindex peaks are present in two galaxies; these could be due to either\nmetallicity gradients or recent star formation activity. In addition,\nsignificant azimuthal CO index variations are seen in NGC 278. Because strong\nazimuthal metallicity gradients are physically implausible in disk galaxies,\nthese features are most naturally explained by the presence of a young stellar\npopulation. The fraction of 2 micron light due to young stellar populations in\nstar forming regions can be calculated from our data. Overall, young stellar\npopulations can contribute ~3% of a (normal) galaxy's near infrared flux.\nLocally, this fraction may rise to ~33%.

We obtained a very small string tension which is inconsistent\nwith the string tension extracted from Polyakov loop correlators. This shows\nthat the Polyakov gauge projected Abelian configurations do not have a\nconsistent physical meaning. We also apply the smoothing on SU(2)\nconfigurations to test how sensitive Abelian dominance in the maximal Abelian\ngauge is to the short distance fluctuations. We find that on smoothed SU(2)\nconfigurations the Abelian string tension was about 30% smaller than the SU(2)\nstring tension which was unaffected by smoothing.

This\nshows, that q-quantization can be generated by Clifford multivector objects\nwhich describe usually composite entities. This contrasts current approaches\nwhich give deformed versions of Clifford algebras by deforming the one-vector\nvariables.
