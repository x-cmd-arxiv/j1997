We show the mass function is a\nfunction of a unique parameter that contains all the dependence on the mass and\nradius of the object. It enables us to derive the mass function of general\nastrophysical objects (in addition to just-virialized halos) which may be\ndefined by any density threshold, that may even vary with the mass of the\nobject. This is beyond the reach of usual formulations based on the initial\ngaussian field and gives a clear illustration of the advantages of our\napproach. We explain why numerical tests seem to favor both Press-Schechter and\nnon-linear prescriptions even though the two approximations differ by their\nscaling as a function of mass as well as a function of redshift. The difference\nbetween the two is due to the fact that the Press-Schechter prescription\nassumes that present-day mass fluctuations can be recognized in the early\nlinear universe, and that their number is conserved, while the non-linear\napproach takes into account their evolution which leads to an increase of the\nnumber of highly non-linear objects (very large or small masses). This\ndifference is seen to be of the same magnitude as the difference obtained by\nvarying the initial spectrum of density fluctuations. Earlier conclusions drawn\nabout the relevance of the latter using analytical approximations to the mass\nfunction must thus be reexamined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 1997 16:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We sketch the general ingredients necessary to\nconstruct these representations and present examples related to spl(2,1) and\nspl(2,2). By revisiting the products of projectivised representations of sl(2),\nwe are able to construct new sets of differential operators preserving some\nspace of polynomials in two or more variables. In particular, this allows to\nexpress the representation of spl(2,1) in terms of matrix differential\noperators in two variables. The corresponding operators provide the building\nblocks for the construction of quasi exactly solvable systems of two and four\nequations in two variables. We also present a quommutator deformation of\nspl(2,1) which, by construction, provides an appropriate basis for analyzing\nthe quasi exactly solvable systems of finite difference equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 1997 12:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
