Roughly put, if X and Y\nare a mirror pair of such manifolds, then X should possess a special Lagrangian\ntorus fibration $f:X\\to B$ such that Y is obtained by dualizing the fibration\nf. This leaves a huge amount to be done to verify such conjectures. This paper\ntakes a speculative point of view, in that it assumes that a special Lagrangian\ntorus fibration exists on X. We address a number of questions of a topological\nnature: what is the relationship between the cohomology of X and the cohomology\nof the dual fibration? what kind of information does the Leray spectral\nsequence for f contain? what is the relationship between the topological (1,1)\ncouplings of the dual of f and the (1,n-1)-couplings of X in the large complex\nstructure limit? These questions are shown to have nice answers if a key\nconjecture about the monodromy diffeomorphisms about a large complex structure\nlimit point holds. Roughly put, this conjecture says that monodromy about a\nlarge complex structure limit point can be described as a very natural\ngeneralization of a Dehn twist for an elliptic curve. Given this conjecture, we\nshow, among other results, that the large complex radius limit of the (1,n-1)\ncouplings on X coincide with the topological (1,1) couplings on Y, and if dim\nX=3, the Leray filtration and weight filtrations of the mixed Hodge structure\ncoincide, as conjectured by myself and P.M.H. Wilson, and independently by D.\nMorrison.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 1997 19:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We first analyze the Quantum-Monte Carlo data for the\nimaginary-time Green's function within the Maximum Entropy method in order to\nobtain the spectral function at real frequencies. For some values of the\nmomentum sufficiently away from the Fermi surface two separate peaks are found,\nwhich can be identified as charge and spin excitations.\n  In order to improve our accuracy and to be able to extend our study to a\nlarger portion of the Brillouin zone, we also fit our data with the\nimaginary-time Green's function obtained from the Luttinger-model solution with\ntwo different velocities as fitting parameters. The excitation energies\nassociated with these velocities turn out to agree, in a broad range of\nmomenta, with the ones calculated from the charge and spin susceptibilities.\nThis allows us to identify these single-particle excitations as due to a\nseparation of spin and charge. Remarkably, the range of momenta where\nspin-charge separation is seen extends well beyond the region of linear\ndispersion about the Fermi surface. We finally discuss a possible extension of\nour method to detect spin-charge separation numerically in two dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 1997 14:06:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 1997 08:29:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 1997 17:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

It is also well known\nthat the latter expansions are generally not literally true beyond the first\nterm. However, the terms in the heat-kernel expansion correspond rigorously to\nquantities called Riesz means of the spectral expansion, which damp out\noscillations in the spectral density at high frequencies by dint of performing\nan average over the density at all lower frequencies. In general, a change of\nvariables leads to new Riesz means that contain different information from the\nold ones. In particular, for the standard second-order elliptic operators,\nRiesz means with respect to the square root of the spectral parameter\ncorrespond to terms in the asymptotics of elliptic and hyperbolic Green\nfunctions associated with the operator, and these quantities contain \"nonlocal\"\ninformation not contained in the usual Riesz means and their correlates in the\nheat kernel. Here the relationship between these two sets of Riesz means is\nworked out in detail; this involves just classical one-dimensional analysis and\ncalculation, with no substantive input from spectral theory or quantum field\ntheory. This work provides a general framework for calculations that are often\ncarried out piecemeal (and without precise understanding of their rigorous\nmeaning) in the physics literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 1997 02:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-06"}

Flamm","title":"Ludwig Boltzmann -- A Pioneer of Modern Physics","comments":"5 pages, Latex","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":"UWThPh-1997-32","categories":"physics.hist-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  In two respects Ludwig Boltzmann was a pioneer of quantum mechanics. First\nbecause in his statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics\nhe introduced the theory of probability into a fundamental law of physics and\nthus broke with the classical prejudice, that fundamental laws have to be\nstrictly deterministic. Even Max Planck had not been ready to accept\nBoltzmann's statistical methods until 1900. With Boltzmann's pioneering work\nthe probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics had already a precedent.\nIn fact in a paper in 1897 Boltzmann had already suggested to Planck to use his\nstatistical methods for the treatment of black body radiation. The second\npioneering step towards quantum mechanics was Boltzmann's introduction of\ndiscrete energy levels. Boltzmann used this method already in his 1872 paper on\nthe H-theorem. One may ask whether Boltzmann considered this procedure only as\na mathematical device or whether he attributed physical significance to it. In\nthis connection Ostwald reports that when he and Planck tried to convince\nBoltzmann of the superiority of purely thermodynamic methods over atomism at\nthe Halle Conference in 1891 Boltzmann suddenly said: ``I see no reason why\nenergy shouldn't also be regarded as divided atomically.'' Finally I would like\nto mention, that Boltzmann in his lectures on Natural Philosophy in 1903\nalready anticipated the equal treatment of space coordinates and time\nintroduced in the theory of special relativity. Furthermore in the lectures by\nBoltzmann and his successor Fritz Hasen\\\"ohrl in Vienna the students learned\nalready about noneuclidean geometry, so that they could immediately start to\nwork when Einstein's general theory of relativity had been formulated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 1997 13:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
