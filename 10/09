In the absence of an\nexternally imposed azimuthal shear, a stationary one-dimensional (1D) pattern\nconsisting of symmetric vortex pairs is formed via a supercritical transition\nat the onset of convection. Shearing reduces the symmetries of the base state\nand produces a traveling 1D pattern whose basic periodic unit is a pair of\nasymmetric vortices. For a sufficiently large shear, the primary bifurcation\nchanges from supercritical to subcritical. We describe measurements of the\nresulting hysteresis as a function of the shear at radius ratio $\\eta \\sim\n0.8$. This simple pattern forming system has an unusual combination of\nsymmetries and control parameters and should be amenable to quantitative\ntheoretical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 1997 15:46:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
