An important albedo source in moderately ionized ionization-bounded\nclouds is that due to neutral hydrogen: Rayleigh scattering of continuum\nphotons off the extreme damping wings of Lya. The photons resulting from this\nscattering mechanism may contribute significantly to the Lya emission line,\nespecially in the very broad wings. In addition, line photons emitted near 1200\nAngstroms (e.g., N V 1240) that stream toward the neutral portion of the cloud\nmay be reflected off this Rayleigh scattering mirror, so that they\npreferentially escape from the illuminated face. Inclusion of this effect can\nalter predicted emission line strengths and profiles. In more highly-ionized\nionization-bounded clouds, Thompson scattering dominates the UV-optical albedo,\nbut this albedo is lessened by the hydrogen gas opacity.

We illustrate the effects of gas density and line\nbroadening on the effective albedo. We also discuss the reflection effects of\nthe accretion disk and the ``dusty torus.'' The accretion disk is an effective\nreflector of UV-optical photons, whether by electron or Rayleigh scattering,\nand it is possible that we observe a significant fraction of this light from\nthe AGN in reflection.
