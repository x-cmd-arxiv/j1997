We first focus on the\nSO(5) model, which involves generalized T=1 pairing. Neither boson mean-field\nmethods nor fermion-pair approximations are able to describe in detail\nneutron-proton pairing in this model. The analysis suggests, however, that the\nboson Hamiltonian obtained from a mapping of the fermion Hamiltonian contains a\npairing force between bosons, pointing to the importance of boson-boson (or\nequivalently four-fermion) correlations with isospin T=0 and spin S=0. These\ncorrelations are investigated by carrying out a second boson mapping. Closed\nforms for the fermion wave functions are given in terms of the fermion-pair\noperators. Similar techniques are applied -- albeit in less detail -- to the\nSO(8) model, involving a competition between T=1 and T=0 pairing.
