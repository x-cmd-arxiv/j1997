Here, the cosmological\nimplications of Milgrom's modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) are considered by\nmeans of a similar procedure. Earlier work by Felten demonstrated that in a\nregion dominated by modified dynamics, the expansion cannot be uniform\n(separations cannot be expressed in terms of a scale factor) and that any such\nregion will eventually re-collapse regardless of the initial expansion velocity\nand mean density. Here I show that, because of the acceleration threshold for\nthe MOND phenomenology, a region dominated by MOND will have a finite size\nwhich, in the early Universe ($z > 3$), is smaller than the horizon scale.\nTherefore, uniform expansion and homogeneity on horizon scale are consistent\nwith MOND-dominated non-uniform expansion and the development of\ninhomogeneities on smaller scale. In the radiation-dominated era, the amplitude\nof MOND-induced inhomogeneities is much smaller than that implied by\nobservations of the cosmic background radiation, and the thermal and dynamical\nhistory of the Universe is identical to that of the standard Big Bang. When\nmatter first dominates the energy density of the Universe, the cosmology\ndiverges from that of the standard model.

The geodesic equation involves formally ill-defined products of\ndistributions due to the nonlinearity of the equations and the presence of the\nDirac $\\de$-distribution in the space time metric. Thus, strictly speaking, it\ncannot be treated within Schwartz's linear theory of distributions. To cope\nwith this difficulty we proceed by first regularizing the\n$\\de$-singularity,then solving the regularized equation within classical smooth\nfunctions and, finally, obtaining a distributional limit as solution to the\noriginal problem. Furthermore it is shown that this limit is independent of the\nregularization without requiring any additional condition, thereby confirming\nearlier results in a mathematical rigorous fashion. We also treat the Jacobi\nequation which, despite being linear in the deviation vector field, involves\neven more delicate singular expressions, like the ``square'' of the Dirac\n$\\de$-distribution. Again the same regularization procedure provides us with a\nperfectly well behaved smooth regularization and a regularization-independent\ndistributional limit.

This leads to a Lorentz-invariant form of the uncertainty relations.\nThis model explains that the quark model and the parton model are two different\nmanifestations of the same covariant model. In particular, this covariant model\nexplains why the coherent amplitudes in the quark model become incoherent,\nafter a Lorentz boost, in the parton model. It is shown that this lack of\ncoherence is consistent with the present form of quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 1997 16:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

We obtain the Hamiltonian\nstructures of the system and check the Jacobi identity through the method of\nprolongation. We also show that this hierarchy of equations can equivalently be\ndescribed in terms of a fermionic Lax operator. We obtain the zero curvature\nformulation as well as the conserved charges of the system starting from this\nfermionic Lax operator which suggests a connection between the two. Finally,\nstarting from the fermionic description of the system, we construct the soliton\nsolutions for this system of equations through Darboux-Backlund transformations\nand describe some open problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 1997 22:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
