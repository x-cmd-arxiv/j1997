For ideal gas with gamma=5/3, the supercomoving position,\nvelocity, density, temperature, and pressure are constant in time in a uniform,\nisotropic, adiabatically expanding universe. Expressed in terms of these\nsupercomoving variables, the cosmological fluid conservation equations and the\nPoisson equation closely resemble their noncosmological counterparts. This\nmakes it possible to generalize noncosmological results and techniques to\ncosmological problems, for a wide range of cosmological models. These variables\nwere initially introduced by Shandarin for matter-dominated models only. We\ngeneralize supercomoving variables to models with a uniform component\ncorresponding to a nonzero cosmological constant, domain walls, cosmic strings,\na nonclumping form of nonrelativistic matter (e.g. massive nettrinos), or\nradiation. Each model is characterized by the value of the density parameter\nOmega0 of the nonrelativistic matter component in which density fluctuation is\npossible, and the density parameter OmegaX of the additional, nonclumping\ncomponent. For each type of nonclumping background, we identify FAMILIES within\nwhich different values of Omega0 and OmegaX lead to fluid equations and\nsolutions in supercomoving variables which are independent of Omega0 and\nOmegaX. We also include the effects of heating, radiative cooling, thermal\nconduction, viscosity, and magnetic fields. As an illustration, we describe 3\nfamiliar cosmological problems in supercomoving variables: the growth of linear\ndensity fluctuations, the nonlinear collapse of a 1D plane-wave density\nfluctuation leading to pancake formation, and the Zel'dovich approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Oct 1997 15:39:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 1997 00:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
