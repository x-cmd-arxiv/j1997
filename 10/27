Our\nprocedure is to k-correct the pixels belonging to the images of a complete set\nof bright galaxies and then to replicate each galaxy image to higher redshift\nby the product of its space density, 1/V_{max}, and the cosmological volume.\nThe set of bright galaxies is itself selected from the HDF because presently\nthe HDF provides the highest quality UV images of a redshift-complete sample of\ngalaxies (31 galaxies with I<21.9, \\bar{z}=0.5, and for which V/V_{max} is\nspread fairly). These galaxies are bright enough to permit accurate\npixel-by-pixel k-corrections into the restframe UV (\\sim 2000 A). We match the\nshot noise, spatial sampling and PSF smoothing of the HDF, resulting in\nentirely empirical and parameter free ``no-evolution'' deep fields of galaxies\nfor direct comparison with the HDF. We obtain the following results. Faint HDF\ngalaxies (I>24) are much smaller, more numerous, and less regular than our\n``no-evolution'' extrapolation, for any relevant geometry. A higher proportion\nof HDF galaxies ``dropout'' in both U and B, indicating that some galaxies were\nbrighter at higher redshifts than our ``cloned'' z\\sim0.5 population. By simple\nimage transformations we demonstrate that bolometric luminosity evolution\ngenerates galaxies which are too large and the contribution of any evolving\ndwarf population is uninterestingly small. A plausible fit is provided by\n`mass-conserving' density-evolution, consistent with hierarchical growth of\nsmall-scale structure.

Famous\nprototypes of these form certain well-known classes of supersymmetric finite\nquantum field theories. Within a perturbative evaluation of the quantum field\ntheories under consideration, the starting point of all such investigations is\nrepresented by the conditions for one- and two-loop finiteness of the gauge\ncouplings as well as for one-loop finiteness of the Yukawa couplings.\nParticularly attractive solutions of the one-loop Yukawa finiteness condition\ninvolve Yukawa couplings which are equivalent to generators of Clifford\nalgebras with identity element. However, a closer inspection shows, at least\nfor all simple gauge groups up to and including rank 8, that these\nClifford-like solutions prove to be inconsistent with the requirements of one-\nand two-loop finiteness of the gauge coupling and of absence of gauge\nanomalies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 1997 12:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

More\nimportantly, this formalism allows us to calculate the self-force on a charged\nparticle in a remarkably simple manner.
