Thermal broadening is unimportant over most of the spectrum, and peculiar\nvelocities tend to make absorption features narrower rather than broader. As a\nconsequence of Hubble flow broadening, there is a close relation between local\nLyman-alpha optical depth and local neutral hydrogen density, which is well\napproximated by the Gunn-Peterson formula.

This sample includes the sources detected in\nthe medium-energy range (2-10 keV) having optical counterparts brighter than\nV=12. We compare the Hipparcos results with ground-based optical data and\nderive probable values for absolute magnitudes and peculiar tangential\nvelocities (v_t). The 4 OB supergiant systems in our sample are high-velocity\nobjects (the average value of v_t is greater than 60 km/s), while the 13 Be\nsystems have low velocities (<v_t> = 11.3 +/- 6.7 km/s), suggesting a different\nformation mechanism for the two subgroups.

We define the wormhole throat in terms of a 2--dimensional\nconstant-time hypersurface of minimal area. (Zero trace for the extrinsic\ncurvature plus a ``flare--out'' condition.) This enables us to derive\ngeneralized theorems regarding violations of the energy conditions---theorems\nthat do not involve geodesic averaging but nevertheless apply to situations\nmuch more general than the spherically symmetric Morris-Thorne traversable\nwormhole.
