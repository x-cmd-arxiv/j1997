In a recent paper, assuming the path integral amplitude to be\ninvariant under the duality transformation ${\\cal R} \\to (L_P^2/{\\cal R})$,\nPadmanabhan has evaluated the modified Feynman propagator in an arbitrary\ncurved spacetime. He finds that the essential feature of this `principle of\npath integral duality' is that the Euclidean proper distance $(\\Delta x)^2$\nbetween two infinitesimally separated spacetime events is replaced by $[(\\Delta\nx)^2 + 4L_P^2 ]$. In other words, under the duality principle the spacetime\nbehaves as though it has a `zero-point length' $L_P$, a feature that is\nexpected to arise in a quantum theory of gravity. In the Schwinger's proper\ntime description of the Feynman propagator, the weightage factor for a path\nwith a proper time $s$ is $\\exp-(m^2s)$. Invoking Padmanabhan's `principle of\npath integral duality' corresponds to modifying the weightage factor\n$\\exp-(m^2s)$ to $\\exp-[m^2s + (L_P^2/s)]$. In this paper, we use this modified\nweightage factor in Schwinger's proper time formalism to evaluate the quantum\ngravitational corrections to some of the standard quantum field theoretic\nresults in flat and curved spacetimes. We find that the extra factor\n$\\exp-(L_P^2/s)$ acts as a regulator at the Planck scale thereby `removing' the\ndivergences that otherwise appear in the theory.
