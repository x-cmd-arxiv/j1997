It is realistic because it assumes the existence of physical\nthings endowed with concrete properties. It is objective because it can be\nformulated without any reference to cognoscent subjects or sensorial fields.\nFinally, it is relational because it assumes that space-time is not a thing but\na complex of relations among things. In this way, the original program of\nLeibniz is consummated, in the sense that space is ultimately an order of\ncoexistents, and time is an order of succesives. In this context, we show that\nthe metric and topological properties of Minkowskian space-time are reduced to\nrelational properties of concrete things. We also sketch how our theory can be\nextended to encompass a Riemmanian space-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Oct 1997 14:25:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
