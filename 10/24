We estimate the Ohmic\ndiffusion time in the hot, deep crust and find that it is noticeably shortened\n(to less than 10^8 yr) from the values characteristic of the colder crusts in\nslowly accreting neutron stars. We speculate on the implications of these\ncalculations for magnetic field evolution in the bright accreting X-ray\nsources. We also explore the consequences of rapid compression at local\naccretion rates exceeding ten times the Eddington rate. This rapid accretion\nheats the atmosphere/ocean to temperatures of order 10^9 K at relatively low\ndensities; for stars accreting pure helium, this causes unstable ignition of\nthe ashes (mostly carbon) resulting from stable helium burning. This unstable\nburning can re-occur on timescales as short as hours to days, and might be the\ncause of some flares on helium accreting pulsars, in particular 4U~1626--67.\nSuch rapid local accretion rates are common on accreting X-ray pulsars, where\nthe magnetic field focuses the accretion flow onto a small fraction of the\nstellar area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 1997 18:31:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 1998 22:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Moreover, the scatter should increase progressively toward decreasing\nmetallicity. Such effects have not been convincingly demonstrated by\nobservations of H II regions in nearby metal-poor galaxies, raising doubts\nabout the time-delay model of primary N production. Pettini et al and Lipman et\nal realized the utility of high-redshift damped Lyman-alpha galaxies for\ngaining further insights into the origin of N and discussed abundances in three\ndamped Lyman-alpha galaxies. Since abundance measurements for O are generally\nunavailable for damped Lyman-alpha galaxies, they used N/Si or N/S in place of\nN/O under the reasonable assumption that the abundance ratios O/Si and O/S are\nthe same as solar in damped Lyman-alpha galaxies. We discuss observations of\nheavy element abundances in 15 high-redshift (z>2) damped Lyman-alpha galaxies,\nmany of which have metallicities comparable to or lower than the lowest\nmetallicity galaxy known locally (I Zw 18). We find that the N/Si ratios in\ndamped Lyman-alpha galaxies exhibit a very large scatter (about 1 dex) at\n[Si/H]~-2 and there is some indication that the scatter increases toward\ndecreasing metallicity. Considerations of various sources of uncertainties\nsuggest that they are not likely the main causes of the large scatter.

The standard technique is to have the local oscillator detuned\nfrom the system (heterodyne detection) so that it is sometimes in phase and\nsometimes in quadrature with the system over the course of the measurement.\nThis enables both quadratures of the system to be measured, from which the\nphase can be estimated. One of us [H.M. Wiseman, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 4587\n(1995)] has shown recently that it is possible to make a much better estimate\nof the phase by using an adaptive technique in which a resonant local\noscillator has its phase adjusted by a feedback loop during the single-shot\nmeasurement. In Ref.~[H.M. Wiseman and R.B. Killip, Phys. Rev.

In this\npaper we present an exact quantum mechanical treatment. This is necessary for\ncalculating the phase variance for fields with small photon numbers, and also\nfor considering figures of merit other than the phase variance. Our results\nshow that an adaptive scheme is always superior to heterodyne detection as far\nas the variance is concerned. However the tails of the probability distribution\nare surprisingly high for this adaptive measurement, so that it does not always\nresult in a smaller probability of error in phase-based optical communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 1997 01:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The aim of this course is to demonstrate the\ncontrary and to unveil the simplicity and the beauty of a subject which is in\nfact the theory of the (explicit) integration of nonlinear differential\nequations.\n  To achieve our goal, we will not start the exposition with a more or less\nprecise ``Painlev\\'e test''. On the contrary, we will finish with it, after a\ngradual introduction to the rich world of singularities of nonlinear\ndifferential equations, so as to remove any cooking recipe.\n  The emphasis is put on embedding each method of the test into the well known\ntheorem of perturbations of Poincar\\'e. A summary can be found at the beginning\nof each chapter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 1997 13:53:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
